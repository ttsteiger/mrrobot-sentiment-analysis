1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,822
You're nothing.

2
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:02,851
You're worthless.

3
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:05,987
Mom, a lot's happened
since last I saw your.

4
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:08,507
I'm not gonna run. You
should probably leave.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,677
This is exactly what you do
when shit like this happens.

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,702
You shut down.

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,702
- Who are you?
- Just a brave traveler

8
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:17,508
who's finally come home.

9
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:20,761
Susan Jacobs, the General
Counsel at E Corp.

10
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:23,188
When they cleared E Corp, you laughed.

11
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,456
There's security
camera footage of him

12
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,667
kidnapping Miss Alderson.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,607
Unless you finish cleaning
up Santiago's mess,

14
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,701
I'm gonna be forced to
do something very bad

15
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:36,704
to your mother.

16
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:37,706
We found their heart.

17
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,695
We rob it, she finally goes down.

18
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:42,023
I know all about Cyprus National Bank.

19
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,160
Her money's as good
as gone. You hear me?

20
00:00:44,163 --> 00:00:45,878
Was that her in the SUV outside?

21
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,986
Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,675
A symbolic breach in the structure

23
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:08,738
that separated millions and
claimed hundreds of lives.

24
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:11,516
That was 1989.

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,894
The world was up for grabs.

26
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:17,774
All the money, power,
natural resources,

27
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,588
hell, even borders were negotiable.

28
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:25,259
The Soviet Union, a
great world super power,

29
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:26,836
was collapsing.

30
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:29,766
And where some saw freedom,

31
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,580
a young, imaginative Minister Zhang

32
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,824
saw possibility.

33
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:38,861
A new world order.

34
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:43,334
So Zhang formed an
investment group called Deus.

35
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,435
The goal, bring together
the world's wealthiest,

36
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,181
most powerful men to consolidate control

37
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:53,638
and manipulate global events for profit.

38
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,582
Zhang courted dignitaries, world leaders,

39
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,917
oligarchs, businessmen,

40
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,027
and he was a damn good salesman.

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,494
The potential profit outweighed

42
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,589
anyone's moral reservations,

43
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,832
which was proven true
in an early endeavor;

44
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,169
the First Gulf War.

45
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,160
Something is happening outside.

46
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:15,708
The skies over Baghdad
have been illuminated.

47
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:18,211
A few backroom deals, a promise here,

48
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,245
a bribe there.

49
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:22,181
Like that, the Deus
Group was rich on oil

50
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,552
and had a foothold in the
military industrial sector.

51
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,763
With the right players in place,

52
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,392
running the world turned
out to be surprisingly easy.

53
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:35,955
I have to say, business was booming.

54
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:40,534
With his network of hackers
and terrorists in place,

55
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,668
Zhang suggested the Deus
Group look in a new direction.

56
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,489
Industrial espionage
was yesterday's work.

57
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:49,568
What better way to gain
leverage on everyone

58
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,471
than if everyone was connected?

59
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,974
During my service in the Congress,

60
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:58,460
I took the initiative
in creating the Internet.

61
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:01,480
The United States was a test case.

62
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,466
Americans seemed the most
ready to give their lives

63
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,818
over to a box.

64
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,734
Without hesitation
everyone jumped online.

65
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,602
Welcome. You've got mail.

66
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,121
Offered everything they had.

67
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:18,772
Bank accounts, electric bills,

68
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,815
medical records, DNA data,

69
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,264
baby pictures.

70
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,486
We staged the biggest
coup in human civilization

71
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,839
and the whole world
volunteered to take part.

72
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,656
Opted in, checked the box,

73
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,843
and clicked, "I agree."

74
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,952
With the Deus Group behind it,

75
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,830
E Corp became the world's biggest front.

76
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,683
With every new device we rolled out,

77
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,062
there was a new way for the Deus Group

78
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,687
to manipulate the public.

79
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,858
But as the world
embraced the digital age,

80
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,752
we began to see that Zhang

81
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,862
had been perfectly positioning himself

82
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,197
to take total control.

83
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,702
Zhang's billion dollar machine,

84
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,645
he clandestinely built it

85
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:01,874
under the Washington
Township Nuclear Power Plant.

86
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:05,878
The Deus Group now understood
we were working for Zhang,

87
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,304
not with him.

88
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:11,197
His pet project which
we'd belittled for years

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,887
had been the singular purpose
of the Deus Group all along.

90
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:27,214
_

92
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:38,660
Consider yourself lucky, Mr. Alderson...

93
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:43,540
That I was the one alerted when
you walked into that apartment.

94
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,586
It's my duty to dispose

95
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,151
of any intruder

96
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,924
and report the attempt.

97
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,801
But you didn't.

98
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:56,553
Why?

99
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,092
Crazy, right?

100
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:09,511
Yeah, I never thought we'd
still be here, either.

101
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,653
Thought we were goners.

102
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,975
But here we are still alive.

103
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:21,936
But that's not the crazy part.

104
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,940
The crazy part is we
were saved by him,

105
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,127
the enemy.

106
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,629
One we've been after this whole time.

107
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,595
Question is, what's the angle?

108
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,215
What's the cost?

109
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:35,967
Because one thing we know by now,

110
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,772
it ain't free.

111
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,522
It won't work...

112
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,416
Your heist.

113
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:47,479
But you just said the Deus
Group funds whiterose's project

114
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,481
and the Dark Army.

115
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,818
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

116
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,653
whiterose loses everything.

117
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,096
But like I said,

118
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:59,992
the Deus Group is impenetrable.

119
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:02,452
Whiterose designed it that way.

120
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,981
You can get us in.

121
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,112
Excuse me?

122
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:15,007
It's like you said.

123
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,451
E Corp is a front for the Deus Group.

124
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:21,013
Last I checked, you're still the CEO.

125
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:27,394
We can take them all
down if we work together.

126
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,048
You have to have a contact at the bank

127
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,768
that can get me the Deus
Group account numbers.

128
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,695
A real contact.

129
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,184
Susan Jacobs.

130
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,881
General Counsel at E Corp.

131
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:49,374
She was my designated associate
for Cyprus National Bank.

132
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,028
She handled everything.

133
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,714
Withdrawals, deposits,

134
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,156
transfers.

135
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:58,749
I would just receive a text

136
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,524
to authorize the transaction, but she...

137
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:03,388
Can get around two-factor authentication.

138
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,665
I just need their phone numbers.

139
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,226
Of course.

140
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,210
You think the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia

141
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,972
has the same cell phone
number for more than five days?

142
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,808
Or the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell?

143
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,977
Let me worry about that.

144
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,763
Just tell me how I can get a
hold of this contact of yours.

145
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,559
Well, that's where you'll
run into some difficulty.

146
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,955
Susan Jacobs disappeared months ago.

147
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,660
And given how open whiterose
is about my inevitable exit

148
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,898
from the group,

149
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,922
I haven't received another contact.

150
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,741
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,

151
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:43,202
but I really can't help you.

152
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,894
You know what they've done.

153
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:52,213
You just gonna let them keep doing it?

154
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,940
You're trying to stop a speeding train

155
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,775
by standing in front of it.

156
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:01,187
All thi... all this,
this is just a blip.

157
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,512
They won't even notice.

158
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,098
Whiterose killed your daughter.

159
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,797
You think I didn't look into you, too?

160
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,288
I don't know how you
justify the shit you do.

161
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:36,964
Maybe you wanna look back at
what whiterose did to Angela

162
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:41,094
and see it as a necessary evil.

163
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:43,638
A cost of doing business.

164
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,070
Or maybe you don't
look back at it at all

165
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,832
because deep down you
know what happened...

166
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,835
what's been happening...

167
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,837
is wrong.

168
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,582
Something inside you is telling you

169
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,660
to stop looking the other way.

170
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,350
That can start here.

171
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:37,191
Even if I were to agree to help you,

172
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,980
it's like I said.

173
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,028
This heist...

174
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,032
It's not possible.

175
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,219
I'll find Susan Jacobs.

176
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,328
Just get them all in a room together.

177
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,000
You want me to randomly request

178
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:57,896
that the entire Deus
Group gather in one place

179
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:02,049
- without even a pretext?
- In the next eight days.

180
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:04,811
Eight days? Is that all?

181
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,995
That's all I got.

182
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:08,890
Once whiterose starts shipping
their project, I'm dead.

183
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:13,245
And how do you expect
me to pull this off?

184
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,688
You've done whiterose's bidding thus far

185
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,614
and paid a horrible cost.

186
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,660
That loyalty won't be lost on her.

187
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,755
You can use that.

188
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,672
And if it's your life
you're worried about...

189
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,940
Doing nothing,

190
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,217
not fighting back...

191
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,389
You may as well be dead.

192
00:10:56,397 --> 00:11:00,292
I became a dead man walking...

193
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:05,872
The minute I agreed
to work with whiterose.

194
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,883
Just like you.

195
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:33,784
What are we supposed to do now?

196
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,713
He isn't out.

197
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:39,625
He just walked out that door.

198
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,774
I'd be dead on the floor of my apartment

199
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,834
if he didn't want in.

200
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,294
He'll be back.

201
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:49,174
Besides, he just gave us
the name of his bank contact.

202
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,826
A contact that's been
missing for months.

203
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,846
So we find out why she disappeared.

204
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,756
We take anything she left behind.

205
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,854
- Yeah?
- It's Mom.

206
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,107
She's gone, Elliot.

207
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:11,658
Your mom was the nicest,
most thoughtful woman.

208
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:12,878
When my dad died,

209
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,057
she gave me a shoulder to cry on.

210
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,036
Always had a kind word for everyone.

211
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,248
You two must feel so blessed
to have had her in your life.

212
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:26,753
Yeah, we feel totally blessed.

213
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,756
What are we supposed to do?

214
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:34,953
Um, well, when my dad died,

215
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,681
- I turned towards the Lord.
- I mean with the boxes.

216
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,251
Oh, well, oftentimes,

217
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,378
like, families find sentimental value

218
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,667
in their loved ones possessions.

219
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,274
Donate everything.

220
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,070
Staff are not allowed to pack up

221
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,981
a deceased patient's belongings.

222
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,267
You can put a Post-It note on the boxes

223
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:00,870
with the items you wish to donate.

224
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,226
About yesterday...

225
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,346
I know I was a little mental.

226
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,065
We're cool.

227
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,944
- Are you just saying that or...
- No, we're good.

228
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,280
Let's just get this done.

229
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,853
Score.

230
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,030
Are you gonna help?

231
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,445
What's the hurry?

232
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:20,033
She's not gonna get any deader.

233
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,519
You know, for someone who
refused to enter this room

234
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,405
in the last few years,

235
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,793
you seem pretty comfortable
now with her gone.

236
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,797
Don't you feel a little relieved?

237
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,083
I know I sound like a total dick,

238
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,428
but you feel it, too, right?

239
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,932
I guess.

240
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:50,930
You know what? Fuck it.

241
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,525
Why should I feel like
a dick for being happy?

242
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,361
She was an asshole to us.

243
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,905
Now I don't ever have
to think about her again.

244
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:12,567
Rad. Your old Walkman.

245
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,004
Why is it even here? Mom hated music.

246
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:17,507
It doesn't matter.

247
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,743
Hold up.

248
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,078
I'll take it if you don't.

249
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,306
Cassettes are full-on back.

250
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,612
What?

251
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,114
Mom had a safe deposit box?

252
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,411
And how long did you
work under ASAC Santiago?

253
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:08,123
Three years, since I
started the New York office.

254
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,587
Describe his disposition
as a senior agent for me.

255
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,090
How'd he treat his squad? Any quirks?

256
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:19,093
- Oddities?
- No.

257
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,354
Santiago was always even-keeled.

258
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,973
He treated everyone
fairly, with respect,

259
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,025
both in the office and out in the field.

260
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,106
Did you ever see Agent
Santiago do anything

261
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:34,608
suspicious or out of character
before his disappearance

262
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,169
on October 23rd?

263
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,155
What do you mean by suspicious?

264
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,634
It's not every day
an ASAC ups and erases

265
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:45,160
security cam footage from
the FBI's parking garage

266
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,380
before dropping off
the face of the Earth.

267
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,048
Oh, right.

268
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,794
You okay there, Agent DiPierro?

269
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:58,173
I'm sorry, just, you
seem a little out of it.

270
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,559
You getting enough rest?

271
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,489
Can I...

272
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,807
just have some water?

273
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,259
Sir, there's something I
know I should tell you, but...

274
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,094
But what?

275
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,345
We're both here for the same reason.

276
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:47,838
To find Agent Santiago,
make sure he's safe.

277
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,368
Now, if there's anything you
can do to help us do that...

278
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,520
I think Agent Santiago
was a double agent.

279
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,401
A double agent?

280
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,717
Yes.

281
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,534
To be clear, Agent DiPierro,

282
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,220
you're accusing your
former commanding officer...

283
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,705
your FBI mentor... of
working as an operative

284
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,248
against the Bureau?

285
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,377
I'm sorry, Agent Horton.

286
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,588
I'm just having a little
trouble saying this aloud

287
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,423
knowing it's on the record and...

288
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:31,484
I'm worried.

289
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,077
I'm worried about what might happen,

290
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,412
about the repercussions.

291
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,583
What repercussions?

292
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,291
Santiago was working with
some awfully dangerous people.

293
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,348
No agent wants to see their brother,

294
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,800
their sister on the
wrong side of the law.

295
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:05,926
I get that.

296
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,430
But you know it's our duty to uphold

297
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:12,525
the integrity of the Bureau.

298
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,309
Well, take a breath.

299
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:19,398
Whenever you're set.

300
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,370
Can you tell me who Agent
Santiago was working with?

301
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,833
The Trujillo drug cartel.

302
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,726
You know, sort of the official punishment

303
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,894
of people who break the law,

304
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,656
and back then in that
place, in that time,

305
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,826
what the state did to
people as part of, you know,

306
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:59,572
lawful justice is worse than
anything Charles Manson did

307
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,333
to the people that he
had killed in his name.

308
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,744
What Charles Manson's

309
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,821
followers did to the
Manson murder victims

310
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,365
is merciful by the standards
of the lawful justice...

311
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,510
- Dugout.
- Bonsai.

312
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,254
Dominique, nice to hear your voice.

313
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,515
- How was the interview?
- Fine.

314
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,607
We're good.

315
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,789
Listen, instead of
Charles Manson doing...

316
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,880
Clarify for me what you mean by good.

317
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:28,526
Um, I fed them the cover story.

318
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,529
He bought it and praised
me for coming forward.

319
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,531
That's encouraging.

320
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,683
So, you believe it was
a successful meeting?

321
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:40,446
Your colleagues believe
all is aboveboard?

322
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,206
I mean, I was a little
nervous at the start,

323
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,399
but then I was fine.

324
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,735
Totally fine.

325
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,364
Agent Horton bought it. I'm sure of it.

326
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:52,383
Clarify sure.

327
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,692
And thought that when you
commit the kind of crimes...

328
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:01,250
Um, I mean, I don't know.

329
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,437
As sure as I can be,
I guess. 99.9% sure.

330
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:07,565
Interesting.

331
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,592
Well, it is just a red letter day.

332
00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:13,762
Now, I know the beginnings
are always the hardest

333
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:17,891
but it's best for
everyone if you stay calm

334
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,893
and keep a level head.

335
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,758
Just one moment.

336
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,610
I'm just finishing a phone call.

337
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,925
Dominique, I want you to
know that we are very pleased

338
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,951
that you are back to
work and on the mend.

339
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:37,359
Don't be a stranger.

340
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,263
Let us know if there's anything you need,

341
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,765
and we'll do the same.

342
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

343
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,271
You know, holidays.

344
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,463
Busy, busy, busy.

345
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,591
What can I do for you?

346
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,593
I want Beatrice with me forever.

347
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:54,779
If you are adulterous or
involved in fornication...

348
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,121
which basically means sex
outside of marriage...

349
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,501
you get your head cut off.

350
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,540
There's the cost of living
and the cost of dying.

351
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:07,792
Seems you're paying the price

352
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,589
whether you're coming or going.

353
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,485
This is taking way too long.

354
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,080
Susan Jacobs?

355
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,250
No, death.

356
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,952
We have to get back to work.

357
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,746
Still running the password cracker

358
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,725
on the Ecoin wallet but nothing yet.

359
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,536
And then there's the real price.

360
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,087
Not cash or Ecoin.

361
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,256
The emotional toll.

362
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:33,258
How are you doing with all this?

363
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,487
As soon as we get the
death certificate, I'm done.

364
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,805
The toll Elliot isn't willing to pay,

365
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:41,284
whether he's not ready to
or just doesn't want to.

366
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:45,270
I'm not talking about paperwork, kiddo.

367
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:48,166
I'm talking about the fact
that your mom died this morning.

368
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,961
Maybe you should take a minute,
deal with what's happening.

369
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:56,340
The fuck are you talking about?

370
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,952
I'm kind of an expert at observing you.

371
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:01,921
All I'm saying is that you need to stop

372
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,348
and take in your mom's death

373
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,958
or it's gonna eat away at you

374
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,227
like everything else you're holding in.

375
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,106
Here's the only thing I'm holding in.

376
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,602
We need to take down whiterose

377
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,103
or we die.

378
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,072
Darlene dies.

379
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:25,062
Did your expert observation
also pick up on that?

380
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,651
I agree. That could
have gone better.

381
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:34,295
Fuck you.

382
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:37,989
Okay, I mean,

383
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:40,626
how the hell should I know
what she would have wanted?

384
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,496
♪ But now it's cold and
Christmas is coming ♪

385
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:45,631
♪ La, la, la, la... ♪

386
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,226
Don't look at me like that.

387
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,637
Yeah, she was my mom,
but we weren't close.

388
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,974
There was no, "These are my
last wishes," conversation.

389
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,235
I mean, fuck.

390
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:00,178
I can't even remember
the last time we spoke.

391
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,483
So give me a goddamn
break here, all right?

392
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:11,356
Cremation, cardboard
coffin, cheapest urn.

393
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:22,200
You're not even a little
curious about what's in it?

394
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:24,670
I mean, she went through
the process of opening

395
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,955
a safe deposit box.

396
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,765
That is not the woman we grew up with.

397
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:33,045
So, I mean, there's gotta
be something important

398
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:34,939
in there, right?

399
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,593
Hello?

400
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,302
Bueller? Are you alive?

401
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,024
No, Darlene, I don't
think there's anything

402
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,764
important in there.

403
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,486
Well, you don't know that for sure.

404
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:51,563
I mean, maybe there's some secrets.

405
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:53,457
Secrets?

406
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,961
I don't know, like the secret
to why Mom was such a bitch.

407
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,630
Money.

408
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:03,042
The deed to a chateau in France.

409
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:06,378
Adoption papers.

410
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:11,083
Your adoption papers.

411
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:13,218
Yo, asshole!

412
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,586
Please stop ignoring me!

413
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:16,088
What the fuck is with you, man?

414
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,222
I'm here, aren't I?

415
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,559
No, you're not.

416
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,260
I thought you said we were cool.

417
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:23,428
We are cool.

418
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,730
Okay, then prove it.

419
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,398
Come with me to the bank.

420
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,975
What is the point?

421
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:31,269
It's not gonna change
the fact that mom's dead.

422
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,739
Just fucking come with me!

423
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,080
I need to go, okay?

424
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,683
Remember when we were kids

425
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,760
and you were scared?

426
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,130
You were having one of your episodes.

427
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:01,007
And I would tell you to squeeze my hand.

428
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,768
And as long as you could feel my hand,

429
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,678
you knew I was there

430
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,366
and it was okay and everything was real.

431
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,538
Well now I need you to help me.

432
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:21,528
Make me feel like everything is okay.

433
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:26,217
You're not gonna find any answers

434
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,387
in the old safe deposit box.

435
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,056
Then it'll be a short trip.

436
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,504
Condolences.

437
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,850
He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen

438
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:53,744
trying to recreate the glory days

439
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,579
but online instead of the streets.

440
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,792
Operates what looks like a
legitimate shipping website.

441
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,756
But shipping people, Mr. Maguire?

442
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,241
More like disappearing people.

443
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,928
We pieced together his
AlphaBay connections

444
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,707
and ID'ed 17 career criminals
he helped walk off the street,

445
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,601
never to be seen again,

446
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,212
living happy lives under new names

447
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,481
all over the world.

448
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,444
Mr. Maguire,

449
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,261
you and I, we could help each other.

450
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,764
You talk to me and maybe
I could put in a good word.

451
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,807
You seem a kind lass

452
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:35,143
and I'd love to help you help me,

453
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:38,063
should I need the helping.

454
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,649
But I'm an innocent man, you see?

455
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:49,800
Agent DiPierro, I'm sorry to interrupt.

456
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,284
You should see this.

457
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,424
Chaos and sadness in Tribeca tonight

458
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:56,789
following the report of an
apparent suicide jumper.

459
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:59,084
You met with him today, didn't you?

460
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:02,629
Did he seem upset or worried or...

461
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:03,981
What are you talking about?

462
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,840
They haven't publicly released the name,

463
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:09,342
but it's Agent Horton
from the Santiago case.

464
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,762
A spokesperson for the
New York Fire Department

465
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,541
confirmed that a middle-aged
man died on impact.

466
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:17,269
He jumped from an eighth
floor apartment window

467
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,145
shortly after 5:00 o'clock this evening.

468
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,439
- _
- At this time that's as much information

469
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:22,873
- _
- as they're willing to release.

470
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,150
- _
- However, I'm told that the identity

471
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,202
has been confirmed and
that the NYFD has notif...

472
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,011
It's gone.

473
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,179
What?

474
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,681
The safe deposit box. It's gone.

475
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,017
Payment lapsed two years ago.

476
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,377
We tried contacting the account owner...

477
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:44,355
your mother... but never heard back.

478
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:47,382
It's policy to dispose of the contents

479
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:49,718
after a 120 day grace period.

480
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,138
You threw away my mom's shit?

481
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,892
It's policy.

482
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,647
What the fuck is wrong with you?

483
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,405
I'll, uh...

484
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:13,199
give you a few minutes.

485
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,894
This is ridiculous. Let's go.

486
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:27,398
We still have to pick
up her fucking ashes.

487
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,784
What's going on?

488
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:58,345
Didn't even know what was in there.

489
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,932
Don't you get it, Elliot?

490
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,434
It's not about the fucking box.

491
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,677
It's about the fact that
you don't give a shit.

492
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,711
About mom?

493
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,963
Fucking sue me for not
giving a shit about her

494
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,965
- after what she did to us.
- Not mom.

495
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,967
Angela.

496
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,951
You were right.

497
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:24,788
She's gone.

498
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:33,113
I mean, how do you do it?

499
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,323
How do you just move on like that?

500
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:44,016
I haven't.

501
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,738
- What are you doing?
- Open it.

502
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,443
You recognize that tape?

503
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,089
How did mom get this?

504
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,883
No idea.

505
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:21,428
This wasn't for her.

506
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,459
Maybe she wished it were.

507
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:30,003
Why would she even listen to it?

508
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,024
She was lonely.

509
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,368
What are you doing?

510
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,371
I'm gonna listen to it.

511
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,373
And you're gonna listen with me.

512
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,361
I can't.

513
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,005
Come on.

00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:42,286

520
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,077
- You ready, Angela?
- Ready.

521
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,120
Okay.

522
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:48,581
Three, two, one.

523
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,420
Good morning, Washington Township.

524
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:52,460
We are your hosts Elliot Alderson...

525
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:53,938
Darlene Alderson...

526
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:55,091
And Angela Moss.

527
00:32:55,094 --> 00:32:57,413
And we're here to say... ready?

528
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,375
Happy Mother's Day, Mrs. Moss!

529
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,945
Happy Mother's Day. I love you, Mom.

530
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,448
We love you, too.

You're a little unbalanced.

534
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:30,516
The tree.

535
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,301
Yes.

536
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,869
To the left.

537
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:48,826
Happy Holidays, Phillip.

538
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,643
I was pleased you reached out,

539
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:55,165
having been so quiet
these past few months.

540
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,042
Is that why you're here?

541
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,671
- To make an attempt at...
- Look.

542
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,374
It would be a waste of both our times

543
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:04,657
to speculate on why I'm here.

544
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,451
The truth is simple.

545
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,662
Let's give that a shot.

546
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:11,664
I'm resigning

547
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:15,602
as CEO of E Corp by the end of year.

548
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,387
Which means, of course,
I'll be parting ways

549
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,949
with the Deus Group as well.

550
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:34,729
Well, that is obviously unacceptable.

551
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:37,523
Your tenure at E Corp
will be over soon enough,

552
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,376
but you will simply have to wait.

553
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,402
Nothing can rock the boat now

554
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:43,571
as my project has not yet shipped.

555
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:47,408
Yes, yes, I understand,
but here's the thing.

556
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,369
I don't care.

557
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,238
Do not forget your loyalty.

558
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:20,125
My loyalty has been unquestionable.

559
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:27,090
You've taken nearly everything from me.

560
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,784
I'd like to leave with
what little I have left.

561
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:34,539
You know that in order for
me to replace you as CEO,

562
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,208
the Deus Group members must all agree

563
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,436
on your successor.

564
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,088
In person.

565
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,441
Well, perhaps a New Year's celebration

566
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:48,261
will befit this fresh start, hmm?

567
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,280
Your request is absurd.

568
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:52,974
You know we can't organize a
meeting within the next week.

569
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:55,994
And yet I have faith you'll find a way.

570
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:02,334
That is not how this
fucking game is played!

571
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:07,405
Game?

572
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:10,324
Game, that word.

573
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:11,582
There's our problem.

574
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,496
There's an end point.

575
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:18,458
There must be, eventually.

576
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,310
And I've reached mine.

577
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:23,814
Since the game is what you care about,

578
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:26,340
you should be happy.

579
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:27,567
You won.

581
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:40,104

582
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,673
Hello?

583
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,818
I played my hand.

584
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,137
And?

585
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,825
And now we wait.

586
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,854
Thank you.

587
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,498
Don't thank me.

588
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,794
I'm not doing this for you.

589
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:34,968
You ready? I've got Mom's ashes.

590
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,764
Who was that?

591
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,100
No one.

592
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:50,174
I saw your phone earlier
when you were here.

593
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:52,444
And on the train platform.

594
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,523
Why are you hacking Susan
Jacobs's Ecoin wallet?

595
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,737
Why do you care?

596
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,198
Because I do.

597
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,759
Why?

598
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:23,842
I knew her.

599
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:43,269
The last transaction
in her Ecoin wallet.

600
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,274
At the animal shelter?

601
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,968
What about it?

602
00:39:02,582 --> 00:39:05,750
That wasn't her.

603
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,960
It was me.

604
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,094
It was you...

605
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:19,263
who broke into her house.

606
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,067
You were in jail.

607
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,996
Fsociety needed a new base.

608
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:29,815
But she caught you.

609
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:36,840
She was supposed to be out of town.

610
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:46,925
Darlene...

611
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,542
what did you do?

612
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:54,006
What, you want me to say it?

613
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,271
Jesus fucking Christ!

614
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,577
I knew you wouldn't get it.

615
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:09,981
Then why did you tell me?

616
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:13,877
I guess I had to know.

617
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,088
Know what?

618
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,800
That we'd still be okay.

619
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,387
Even if you knew what I did.

620
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,917
I read what she did.

621
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,736
The Washington Township case.

622
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,604
I need everything you
have on Susan Jacobs.

623
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:17,440
Why?

624
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:25,690
Susan Jacobs was also
working for the Dark Army.

625
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,963
And what does that have to do with you?

626
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,408
I'm going after whiterose.

627
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,884
You know that's suicide, right?

628
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:58,815
Probably.

629
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,725
And you're gonna do it anyway?

630
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:07,991
Why not give up?

631
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,184
Can't.

632
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:12,269
She'll find me.

633
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,835
Us.

634
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,862
She'll find us both. That's
why you're doing this.

635
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,453
I'm in.

636
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:31,330
No.

637
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,855
This is exactly why I didn't
tell you in the first place.

638
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:36,168
I'm not giving you a choice.

639
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,462
Besides, you need me.

640
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:41,173
Face it, every hack
you've ever pulled off

641
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,967
is because Fsociety helped you,

642
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:46,528
and right now we're
all that's left, okay?

643
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:50,200
If this is the biggest
thing you're ever gonna do,

644
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:52,810
then we're doing it together.

645
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:56,114
Give me your phone.

646
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,385
I rigged Signal's API to beam GPS coords

647
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:10,494
so we can share locations.

648
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:12,222
That way if you're
ever worried about me,

649
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,224
you'll know where I am.

650
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:16,467
It's done.

651
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,752
Okay, I'm in whether you like it or not.

652
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,842
I honestly wasn't expecting
you to say whiterose.

653
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:26,531
I mean, I knew you were up to something,

654
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,906
but you were acting like
such a total sketchball,

655
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,891
I figured it had to do with Vera.

656
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:37,155
Vera?

657
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,457
What are you talking... what
does he have to do with anything?

658
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:41,030
Well, that's what I was wondering.

659
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:42,837
I mean, he freaked me the fuck out

660
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,087
when he showed up at your building

661
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,923
a couple months ago,
but when I told you,

662
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:49,926
you just blew it off
like it was no big deal.

663
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,272
I don't need to worry about him, do I?

664
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,280
No.

665
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:13,432
You should get going.

666
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,559
Pull everything you have on Susan.

667
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,942
You coming?

668
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:27,071
I'll be right there.

669
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:32,802
Elliot, thanks...

670
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,379
For today.

671
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:47,292
I don't know what Darlene is talking...

672
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:48,808
Price made his move.

673
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,594
We might actually have
a shot at whiterose.

674
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,972
But none of that matters 'cause
I can't fucking trust you!

675
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:53,985
Listen to me.

676
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:55,498
I don't know anything about Vera.

677
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:56,976
You heard what she said.

678
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:59,329
She told one of us, and it wasn't me.

679
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:01,154
There's no reason for
me to keep that from you.

680
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,073
Fuck it!

681
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,205
You wanna go back to not
talking to each other?

682
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,627
Locking each other out?
Fighting for control?

683
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,340
Look at me! I am telling you the truth.

684
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:13,659
I am not the one Darlene talked to.

685
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:25,188
If it wasn't you,

686
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,689
and it wasn't me...

687
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,343
Who was it?

688
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,076
I've been looking all over for you.

689
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:27,584
You shouldn't be sitting
there. That's not your seat.

690
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:28,659
Why? I thought...

691
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,087
They're not ready yet.

692
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:34,073
- We need to wait.
- For what?

693
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:35,967
For him.

694
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,095
You mean Mr. Robot?

695
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,005
No.

696
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,414
Elliot?

697
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,933
No.

698
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,044
The other one.
