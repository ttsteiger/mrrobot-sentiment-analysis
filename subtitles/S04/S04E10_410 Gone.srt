1
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,108
‐ Alexa, are we friends?
‐ Yes.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:09,877
‐ She said you haven't
been sleeping.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,812
You need your rest.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,882
‐ You still having them?

5
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:15,849
‐ In this day and age,

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,985
it's sicker not
having panic attacks.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,052
Fuck!

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,889
‐ Wow. I've never touched
something so beautiful.

9
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,524
‐ I feel the same way
each time.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,858
‐ Can't we just be
a normal couple

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,694
that looks up
vacation packages to Budapest?

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,529
‐ Just so you know‐‐

13
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,897
Full‐time freelance now.

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,465
Only loyalty is to
the almighty paper.

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,536
‐ I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,538
Everything you need to know
is on here.

17
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,139
‐ You can't make
your own currency.

18
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,074
That is the federal
government's job.

19
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,245
‐ With Ecoin equal to $1,
we are the authority.

20
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,047
‐ You know that night
we spent together.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,516
‐ So this is why you came here.
You were just using me.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,352
‐ You know it was
more than that.

23
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,754
‐ Well, I am not
leaving you like this.

24
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,222
‐ You wanna help me?

25
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,423
‐ This is all my fault.

26
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,591
‐ Take them down.

27
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,563
‐ The data dump
from fsociety was easily

28
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,133
the largest and most damning
doxxing case in history.

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,869
While only a small percentage
of the documents in the breach

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,537
have been substantiated
at this time,

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,007
those that have
are proving to be accurate.

32
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,075
With regard to their source,

33
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,510
the intelligence community
is cautioning

34
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,546
the overall veracity
of the data dump

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,182
and rush to judgment, citing
fears falsified documents‐‐

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,384
‐ And then your 1K letter
to the FBI will be issued

37
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,886
by the US Attorney's office

38
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,387
once everything you've told us,

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,091
and what you've logged in here,
checks out.

40
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,859
Now, I do need to mention

41
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,862
these are some serious crimes
you committed, Agent DiPierro.

42
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,364
You may come out of this
with a record.

43
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,565
There's not much
we can do about that.

44
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,501
‐ China's Minister of State
Security has been exposed

45
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,771
as the infamous hacker
and leader of the Dark Army

46
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,139
known only as Whiterose.

47
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,742
Intelligence officials
who have long thought

48
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,077
Whiterose's identity...

49
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,779
‐ Those dresses he showed me.

50
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,083
‐ Were the key to confirming
Zhang's double life.

51
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,552
‐ He was trying to tell me
who he was.

52
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,288
‐ Saying it was the missing
link that finally allowed them

53
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,656
to connect Whiterose...

54
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,192
‐ I'm sorry,
who are you referring to?

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,296
‐ China has yet to officially
respond to the claims...

56
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,165
‐ Nothing.

57
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,701
‐ In either the Deus Group
or the Dark Army.

58
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,702
‐ As for your job
at the Bureau,

59
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,004
you're on administrative leave
for six months

60
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,841
until OPR does their thing.
‐ What's in the bag?

61
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,176
‐ Oh. This is saline.

62
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,678
We'll be putting
some medicine in there

63
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,913
so you can get some rest.
‐ No.

64
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,116
No drugs.
I don't want any drugs.

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,984
I'm gonna leave soon anyway.

66
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,020
‐ Oh, sweetie, you can't
leave here anytime soon.

67
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,856
‐ She's right, Dom.
You need to stay put.

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,691
Plus, with everything
going on out there,

69
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,326
we don't think you should
go home anyway.

70
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,629
‐ I'm not going home.
I need to see my family.

71
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,631
‐ They're in one of
our safe houses, Dom.

72
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,235
SO‐4's watching them,
24/7 rotation.

73
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,270
‐ I need to see them
for myself.

74
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,239
‐ Have already issued a joint
statement on the matter.

75
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,908
‐ Um... that can't happen.

76
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,376
‐ The heck is that
supposed to mean?

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,113
They're my family.
I should be able to see them.

78
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,450
‐ It's like I said.
Until OPR clears you‐‐

79
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,518
‐ I'm not cleared?

80
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,821
‐ World Bank, WTO,
and the US Federal Reserve

81
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,323
are still trying
to piece together the events.

82
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,959
Reports continue to come in
from around the globe

83
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,695
of the far reaching
cyber heist.

84
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,729
‐ I can't believe this.

85
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,164
‐ The confirmed victims
of the robbery

86
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,000
include prominent businessmen,
CEOs...

87
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,638
‐ You don't trust me to know
where my own family is?

88
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,840
‐ Not now, no.

89
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,041
‐ Officials believe
the compromised Deus Group

90
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,478
accounts were managed by
Cyprus National Bank.

91
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,047
They're thought to be
at the center of the hack.

92
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,217
‐ You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

93
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,719
‐ All you need
to worry about right now

94
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,487
is getting a good
night's sleep.

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,556
This hospital's gonna take
great care of you.

96
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,057
Now make sure she gets
whatever she needs.

97
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,561
‐ Deus Group lost trillions of
dollars in cyber‐attacks.

98
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,230
Law enforcement authorities
suspect fsociety

99
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,898
to be the architects
of the heist‐‐

100
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,734
‐ Can I get you anything
before I go?

101
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,836
‐ I wanna go home.

102
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,070
‐ Pardon me?

103
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,672
‐ I have to go home.

104
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,707
‐ Sweetheart,
it's like I said earlier,

105
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,675
the doctor isn't recommend‐‐

106
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,610
‐ The doctor said
the surgery went great.

107
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,846
Right?

108
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,814
And I'm able to walk around
just fine

109
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,517
as long as I don't
tear my stitches.

110
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,954
You can't legally keep me here
if I wanna leave.

111
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,758
‐ Yes, we can discharge you
against medical advice, but‐‐

112
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,093
‐ That's what I want.

113
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,900
I really appreciate this, but
I don't need this wheelchair.

114
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,136
‐ Hospital policy, ma'am.

115
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,637
Did the nurse call
your pickup contact?

116
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,838
‐ What?

117
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,607
‐ Who's picking you up?

118
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,841
‐ Nobody's picking me up.

119
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,809
‐ What's that?

120
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,477
‐ Just gonna grab a cab.

121
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,446
‐ You can't do that, ma'am.

122
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,747
‐ Why not?

123
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,116
‐ Since the hospital
administered anesthesia,

124
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,252
you have to have
somebody with you.

125
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,421
Can't just put you in a cab
with a stranger.

126
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,758
You sure there's
nobody you can call?

127
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,426
A friend, a family member‐‐

128
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,828
‐ No.

129
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,866
I don't have anyone.

130
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,335
‐

131
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,137
What about one of those FBI
guys that was here earlier?

132
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,605
I could give
one of them a call.

133
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,307
‐ Definitely not.

134
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,408
‐ All right.

135
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,678
I'm gonna check the
Social Services volunteer list

136
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,447
and see who we have
available today.

137
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,449
It'll just take a sec.

138
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,451
Hang tight.
I'll be back.

139
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,420
‐ This is ridiculous‐‐I told
you, I'm good, I'm just gonna‐‐

140
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,122
‐ Can I trust you to behave?

141
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,758
Or do we need to bring
security over here?

142
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,174
‐ Open up. We don't have
a lot of time.

143
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,861
What the fuck is
going on here?

144
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,398
Don't worry about that.
We're not staying.

145
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,466
You shouldn't even be here.

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,567
When I‐‐

147
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,404
It took me forever to find
what hospital you were at,

148
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,172
and when I found out
you went home‐‐

149
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,573
‐ Want a grilled cheese
sandwich?

150
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,046
‐ Why are you even here?

151
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,981
Shouldn't you still be
at the hospital?

152
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,917
‐ Probably.

153
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,619
Figured not
the safest place to be,

154
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,889
given what you guys did.

155
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,325
Saw the news, guess you really
pulled it off.

156
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,161
‐ Which is why we need to
get the fuck out of here.

157
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,063
Elliot and I have
a getaway plan lined up,

158
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,131
and I think it'd be in your
