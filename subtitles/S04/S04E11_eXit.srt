1
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:09,476
Exciting time in the world right now.

2
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,751
Some believe there are
alternate realities

3
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:13,439
with other lives that we're leading.

4
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,388
_

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,411
_

6
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,183
How many copies of ourselves exist,

7
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,562
and might our mental
states be conjoined?

8
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,853
Zhang's machine, he built it under

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,023
the Washington Township Power Plant.

10
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,954
26 employees died from Leukemia.

11
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:31,522
I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo.

12
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,440
I want you to destroy
whiterose's machine.

13
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,940
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

14
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,897
Do you ever think that
if you imagine something,

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,078
it would come true?

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,557
It happened. It actually happened.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,265
Are you sure you don't
wanna come with us?

18
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:46,705
I can't. I'm not done.

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,201
Where did the Dark Army go?

20
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:51,539
Your dream is as good as dead.

21
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,039
FBI. Open the door.

22
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,311
We're going in!

23
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,814
Three, two, one!

24
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,372
You were looking for Minister Zhang?

25
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,374
He isn't here.

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,968
He's dead.

27
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,140
There is only Whiterose.

28

29
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,003
Any advice for a road trip?

30
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,671
I've never been on one before.

31
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,084
Neither have I.

32
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:36,257
Recommend getting a
bunch of Sour Patch Kids.

33
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,687
I've been through a lot, Darlene.

34
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,876
Thank you for never giving up on me.

35
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,561
I should get going.

36
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,477
We really pulled this off, didn't we?

37
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,150
Fuck yeah, we did.

38
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:50,664
You know, you really
started to grow on me

39
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,666
ever since you stopped
being such a dickhead.

40
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,518
Please tell me you're
not really doing this.

41
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
From what I saw on that drive,

42
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,613
I can make the software

43
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,241
on Whiterose's machine
completely unusable.

44
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,293
It will shut it down for good.

45
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,423
You mean the machine

46
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:24,051
that's in a goddamn nuclear power plant?

47
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,533
We fuck up, this will cause a meltdown.

48
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,129
The right malware can corrupt
the machine's entire system.

49
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,872
It won't even be able to start.

50
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,208
It would take decades
for them to recode it.

51
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,627
No! We're done, remember?

52
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,212
This is what we agreed to.

53
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,047
That's what last night was.

54
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,715
The last step.

55
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,218
We stick with the plan, we leave.

56
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,095
Besides, it would take you forever

57
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,938
to write that malware anyway.

58
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:57,990
You've already written it, haven't you?

59
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,994
It wasn't that hard.

60
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:05,239
I used the same root kit
we used to infect E Corp.

61
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:09,671
All I need to do is access a terminal
on their network and plug it in.

62
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,511
This is not what we set out to do!

63
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:14,344
Whiterose isn't dead
until her machine is!

64
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,792
Since when did her
machine become our goal?

65
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,919
You don't get it, do you?

66
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,349
That's where all of this started!

67
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,185
You go down this path, it'll never end.

68
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:39,815
It'll always be something else.

69
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,848
Another symbol to destroy,

70
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,685
more people to save.

71
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,156
This is an endless war.

72
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,701
At a certain point,

73
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,369
we gotta move on.

74
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,055
Maybe you should go with them.

75
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,046
Please don't shut me out now.

76
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,452
I'm not shutting you out.

77
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,732
I want to do this one on my own.

78
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,072
Hey.

79
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,200
You're in the wrong place.

80
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,777
Usually I hand pick someone
to do the introductions,

81
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,955
but I felt that unnecessary
since we've already met.

82
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,919
Please, have a seat.

83
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,092
This isn't gonna work on me.

84
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,888
What are you referring to?

85
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:34,094
The computer I used growing up.

86
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,846
A book my dad used to read.

87
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,982
You even got Qwerty here somehow.

88
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,861
It may have worked on Angela,

89
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:45,197
but your brainwashing
isn't gonna work on me.

90
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:52,037
This procedure has never
been about brainwashing.

91
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,166
It is about helping you
come to an understanding.

92
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,542
What's in the box?

93
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:09,170
I had a lot of pain growing up.

94
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,724
I wasn't born who I was meant to be,

95
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:15,969
and it cost me a lot.

96
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,013
It cost me my one true love.

97
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,686
It cost me the life I was
owed, the world I deserved.

98
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,905
You're not answering my question.

99
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,149
This world around us, I'm tired of it.

100
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,457
I'm tired of the pain it causes.

101
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,835
I'm tired of the disappointment it is,

102
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:36,247
and all I've been trying to do, Elliot,

103
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,751
all I ever wanted was to finally bring

104
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,661
an end to that dysfunction

105
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,331
and deliver us a better world.

106
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,593
You don't want to help the world.

107
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,104
You want to destroy it.

108
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,776
You want to destroy it
because you hate people

109
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:08,271
for what they've done to you,

110
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,399
and you can't look past that
to actually see the good in it.

111
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,411
Elliot, please.

112
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,300
Don't make me laugh.

113
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:33,305
You think I'm the one that
wants to destroy the world?

114
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:36,382
I'm the one that hates people?

115
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,927
That can't see the good in it?

116
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,499
Look around you.

117
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,242
Everywhere we turn,

118
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:48,269
all we see is spite from
our so-called fellow man.

119
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,191
Every day we turn on the news,

120
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,482
we're constantly told by our leaders,

121
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,776
our scientists, our religions

122
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,113
that our world is crumbling,
and that we are the problem.

123
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,659
We are the root of
everything that is wrong,

124
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,003
that we don't stand a chance.

125
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,883
We are told this so
much that self-hatred

126
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:11,501
is no longer considered
an anomaly but a given,

127
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,964
and yet you dare point the finger at me

128
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,849
when I try to bring order to its chaos?

129
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:23,021
When I have sacrificed
everything to make it better?

130
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,187
Please!

131
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,691
Don't make me laugh.

132
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,544
On the contrary,

133
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:51,040
it is my love for people that drives me.

134
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,627
It always has been, because I know,

135
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:59,507
deep in every person's heart...

136
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,343
They are trying to be good.

137
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:09,067
They were just dealt a bad
hand by a world unfit for us

138
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:14,314
so please don't make me fucking laugh

139
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:18,418
and accuse me of hating
people when you, Elliot,

140
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:21,746
wear that hate like a badge of honor!

141
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,792
Shall I remind you of your group's name?

142
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:36,753
Admit it.

143
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,833
Hatred has been your anthem,

144
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,952
not mine.

145
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:52,763
You're right.

146
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,347
I hate people.

147
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,568
I'm scared of them.

148
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,331
I've been scared of them
practically my whole life.

149
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,267
People I loved... people I trusted...

150
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,174
have done their absolute worst to me.

151
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:21,696
And for a long time,
that's all I ever knew.

152
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:28,721
So, yeah, I called my group fsociety,

153
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,901
because you know what? Fuck society.

154
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,314
Society deserves to
be hated for everything

155
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,284
you said they did and more.

156
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,321
Fuck every last one of them

157
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,500
for what we've all been through.

158
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:01,805
But then there are
some people out there...

159
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:07,510
And it doesn't happen a lot.

160
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,048
It's rare.

161
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:14,854
But they refuse to let you hate them.

162
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:22,033
In fact, they care
about you in spite of it.

163
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:25,699
And the really special ones,

164
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:30,038
they're relentless at it.

165
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,451
Doesn't matter what you do to them.

166
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:36,714
They take it and care about you anyway.

167
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,002
They don't abandon you,

168
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,431
no matter how many
reasons you give them.

169
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,214
No matter how much you're

170
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:52,811
practically begging them to leave.

171
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,030
And you wanna know why?

172
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,414
Because they feel something
for me that I can't.

173
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,684
They love me.

174
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:44,690
And for all the pain I've been through,

175
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,569
that heals me.

176
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,280
Maybe not instantly.

177
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,449
Maybe not even for a long time,

178
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,745
but it heals.

179
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,915
And, yeah, there are setbacks.

180
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:05,545
We do fucked up things to each other.

181
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,632
And we hurt each other,
and it gets messy,

182
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,927
but that's just us,

183
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,889
in any world you're in.

184
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:20,226
And, yeah, you're right.

185
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:25,106
We're all told we don't stand a chance,

186
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:29,151
and yet we stand.

187
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:34,907
We break, but we keep going,

188
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:39,504
and that is not a flaw.

189
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:43,416
That's what makes us.

190
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:47,895
So, no, I will not
give up on this world.

191
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,173
And if you can't see why,

192
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,928
then I speak for everyone when I say,

193
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,847
fuck you!

194
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:08,905
Pity.

195
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:11,484
I thought we shared a vision.

196
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,112
What is that?

197
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,026
It appears the plant is losing power

198
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,991
- to the cooling system.
- Why?

199
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,220
As you can imagine,

200
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,841
my machine requires a
significant amount of water,

201
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:23,623
so it has to draw all the plant's power,

202
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,499
including its backup generators.

203
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,043
You turned it on?

204
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,878
Of course I have.

205
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,173
- We're on a very tight schedule.
- Your machine.

206
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,726
It won't work. I installed malware.

207
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:36,636
Yes, we discovered your breach.

208
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,229
How do you think we found you?

209
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,397
Then you know it already executed.

210
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,975
Except for the fact that my
machine was already running

211
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,311
by the time you installed
your little exploit.

212
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,812
No, you don't understand.

213
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,408
Earlier you accused
me of being a murderer,

214
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,639
but soon you will see all
those lives that have been lost

215
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,005
so that we could get to this point

216
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:57,239
will not be in vain.

217
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,158
In fact, they won't be lost at all.

218
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,578
They will all be found again
as soon as this world around us

219
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,332
transforms into a parallel world.

220
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,926
A world where we were
meant to be all along.

221
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,712
The machine can't run
here, and you know that.

222
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,264
It's going to cause a meltdown.

223
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:16,509
Which is why I have been
trying to move my project.

224
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,512
Our tests here were quite
limited in proximity,

225
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,430
however you left me no choice.

226
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,107
Haven't you killed enough people?

227
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:27,186
Nobody will be killed.
The opposite, actually.

228
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,188
We will be reborn as new,

229
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,784
finally liberated from the
horrific and brutal past

230
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,777
that we've been shackled to for so long.

231
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,696
You can't do this.

232
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,171
You said you loved people,

233
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:39,677
but you're not giving them a choice.

234
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,763
You're not liberating them.

235
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,075
You're forcing this on them.

236
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,787
I am giving them a choice.

237
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,874
That's why you're here.

238
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:52,970
I'm going to show you
what I showed Angela.

239
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:56,590
What do you mean?

240
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,427
All I ever wanted from you, Elliot,

241
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,039
was your belief.

242
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,600
What are you gonna do with that?

243
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,895
I have learned to
listen when time speaks.

244
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,886
Our paths were too precisely
linked to this moment

245
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,776
for there not to be a reason.

246
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,910
This is why.

247
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:18,876
You get to decide.

248
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:21,013
Then I'm telling you, don't do this!

249
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,692
I don't know what the fuck to do.

250
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,813
We need to figure out
the code to this door.

251
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:56,379
Try that phone.

252
00:28:56,382 --> 00:28:58,359
See if you can get an outside line.

253
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:04,709
- Zero five zero nine.
- Zero five zero nine.

254
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,453
Zero five zero nine.

255
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,708
- Anything?
- Zero five zero nine.

256
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:13,527
Zero five zero nine.

257
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:17,378
Zero five zero nine.

258
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,950
Let's go!

259
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:29,072
There's an access tunnel down the hall.

260
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,353
_

261
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,689
If we leave,

262
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,177
the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.

263
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,361
Which is why we need to
get as far fucking away

264
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,570
from here as possible.

265
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,247
If we don't stop this,

266
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,241
the meltdown will
destroy the whole town.

267
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,909
You wanna stop the meltdown?

268
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,895
How the fuck are we gonna do that?

269
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,084
She said she gave me a choice.

270
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,256
We don't have time for this shit.

271
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,765
I don't think this is just a game.

272
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,726
This place is gonna blow!

273
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,396
This is an override process
to turn off the machine.

274
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:20,654
_

275
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,827
_

276
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:32,899
_

277
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:37,931
_

278
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,772
_

279
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,616
_

280
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:54,642
_

281
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,202
We've gotta get the fuck out of here!

282
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,374
_

283
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:07,640
_

284
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:11,075
_

285
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,490
_

286
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,725
_

287
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:22,853
_

288
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,141
It didn't work. The
alarms are still going.

289
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:35,530
We've gotta go!

290
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:40,364
No, I'm missing something.

291
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,691
She wanted us to win.

292
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,735
_

293
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,923

294
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,371

295
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:09,256

296

_

299
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,853
Did it work?

300
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:34,812
It's too late, isn't it?

301
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:08,131
I love you.

302
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:18,472
I love you, too.

303
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,031
It's an exciting time in the world.

304
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,315
This is your wakeup call.

305
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:14,987
This is your wakeup call.

306
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,491
This is your wakeup call.

307
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,547

340
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,126
Did you feel that?

341
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,502
Was that an earthquake?

342
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,296
It can't be, can it?

343
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,631
In New York City?

344
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,174
I don't know.

345
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,968
So weird.

346
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,554
Anyway, are you ready?

347
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,014
For what?

348
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,413
Presentation.

349
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,497
You said that you needed to stay
up all night working on it.

350
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,523
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

351
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,484
I don't know where my head is at.

352
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,154
Are you okay?

353
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:05,624
I woke up with a really bad headache.

354
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:11,463
I see you also haven't made
any progress on packing.

355
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,003
I bought tape.

356
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:23,976
Okay, well, that's not nothing.

357
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,594
But it is almost nothing.

358
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,768
My dad just E-mailed me.
I have to head into work.

359
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,398
Don't tell me he's still
checking the traffic for you.

360
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:38,980
You are such an only child.

361
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,068
You know me.

362
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,781
So I'll talk to you later, okay?

363
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,232
Elliot,

364
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:50,744
you're not keeping
anything from me, are you?

365
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,873
What would I be keeping from you?

366
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,543
I don't know.

367
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:02,181
You just seem different.

368
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,386
Must be this migraine I woke up with.

369
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,430
Now it's a migraine?

370
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,474
I'll check in with you later?

371
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,129
Love you.

372
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,506
I love you.

373
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:18,102
Hey.

374
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,806
Can't wait to marry you tomorrow.

375
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,670
Your call has been forwarded to an un...

376
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,771
Mr. Robot, computer repair with a smile.

377
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,683
- This is Edward.
- Dad, where were you?

378
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:03,442
You're not answering your cell.

379
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,319
Ah, you know I always loose
track of that thingamajig.

380
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,362
What's up, son?

381
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,614
I think Angela knows.

382
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,825
That's impossible.

383
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,368
No, I just talked to her.

384
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,454
She was acting suspicious.

385
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,789
I'm sure you're
just being paranoid.

386
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,458
There's no way she could know.

387
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,210
Dad, I have a feeling,

388
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,380
if she finds out, it
will ruin everything.

389
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,341
Okay. Calm down.

390
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,698
I'm sure you're just
nervous about tomorrow.

391
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:32,179
Try to act normal.

392
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,973
There's no way she's
gonna find out, okay?

393
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,641
You're right.

394
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,226
- Okay.
- Just finishing up a call.

395
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,479
Be out in a jiff.

396
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,965
I got a customer. We still on for lunch?

397
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:45,317
- Yeah.
- Okay.

398
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,485
See you soon.

399
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,821
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

400
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,157
Thanks.

401
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,201
No problem.

402
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,496
I'm always here for you.

403
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,829
Sorry for the wait. How can I help you?

404
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:06,739
Oh.

405
00:41:06,742 --> 00:41:08,841
There you are.

406
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,810
_

407
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,853
Residents of the Tri-State area

408
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,448
were shaken up when a
5.9 magnitude tremor

409
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,525
struck Washington Township, New Jersey

410
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,735
- at about 7:30...
- Yo.

411
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,195
Yo.

412
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,270
Do you have that deck ready?

413
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:38,203
E Corp guys will be here any minute.

414
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,296
What?

415
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:42,299
For the meeting.

416
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,042
You just said E Corp.

417
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,969
Don't you mean F Corp?

418
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,137
F Corp.

419
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,588
Yeah, that's what I meant.

420
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,048
You nervous?

421
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,133
You're never like this
before presentation.

422
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,831
You're always stone cold.

423
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,315
Yeah, I don't know. I'm
not myself today, man.

424
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:01,870
What's up, my dudes?

425
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:02,980
Ollie.

426
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:04,149
Yeah, I heard we were taking

427
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:06,744
a swing at F Corp today, B-Moc.

428
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:09,067
- I'm sorry?
- B-Moc.

429
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,496
The Big Man on Campus.

430
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:15,481
- I don't think that's a thing.
- It might be a stupid thing.

431
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:17,576
Anyway, here's what's up.

432
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,661
I'm awesome at talking to people.

433
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,912
For real, though.

434
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,414
Lunches, dinners, drinks.

435
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:25,083
I could sell ice to an
Arab, sand to an Eskimo.

436
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,961
Yeah, you're not helping
yourself out there.

437
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,255
Unless you're experimenting
with some new form or racism.

438
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,967
I just want you to know I can
be an asset for when... not if...

439
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,969
but when you land this account.

440
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:39,146
What do you say?

441
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:41,141
You know what? Don't
take my word for it.

442
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,601
I... I wanna take you out to lunch

443
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,352
and prove to you what I'm all about.

444
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,696
But not today, though.

445
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:47,955
I'm meeting my new girl, Stella B.

446
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:50,534
Don't tell the girls in the office.

447
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,280
Cool, man. Glad we did this.

448
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,990
Seriously.

449
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:00,711
Just pull up the debt and
look over all the slides.

450
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:02,621
Let's build our future together...

451
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:03,893
When you have lunch with him,

452
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:06,123
will you please tell him
to never talk to me again?

453
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,836
Together we can change
the world with F Corp.

454
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,341
Zhi Zhang, the world's richest person,

455
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:17,302
continues to make news for
her philanthropic endeavors.

456
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,805
Last month Miss Zhang
donated $4.6 billion

457
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,642
to her personal charity,
the Whiterose Foundation,

458
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,235
according to a filing published

459
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:27,274
by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

460
00:43:27,277 --> 00:43:29,740
Earth to Elliot.

461
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:30,782
You all right?

462
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,079
Just make sure all the
flow charts are accurate.

463
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:40,375
We really need to land this account.

464
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,536
Okay.

465
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:01,010
_

466
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,796
With Allsafe at the wheel,

467
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:05,091
F Corp can do what they do best...

468
00:44:05,094 --> 00:44:08,504
navigate the world to a brighter future.

469
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:11,141
Any questions?

470
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,663
Can Elliot and I have the room, please?

471
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,547
I appreciate your presentation,

472
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:38,725
but I don't think this
place is right for us.

473
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,815
And why is that?

474
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,281
Let me ask you something, Elliot.

475
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,620
What's the worst thing
about your life right now?

476
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:01,906
Well, the fact that you're
passing on us already,

477
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,491
I'd have to go with this meeting.

478
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,710
No, seriously.

479
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,295
Answer my question.

480
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,509
If I'm being honest...

481
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:17,214
The worst thing in my life...

482
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:21,518
Is also the best thing.

483
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:27,265
I get up every morning,

484
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,934
I play my records,

485
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,478
I get ready,

486
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,865
get my coffee, I come to work,

487
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,535
I'm stuck in a
repetitive, boring routine

488
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:41,496
that feels endless.

489
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:47,452
And, sure, I've imagined
what it would be like

490
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:52,290
to be someone with a more exciting life.

491
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,334
A risk-taker.

492
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:57,596
Someone more interesting.

493
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:04,060
But in the end, I know
I'm lucky to be where I am.

494
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,358
Please have a seat.

495
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:25,657
I also feel the same
about my life at F Corp.

496
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,961
It's the best and the worst
thing that happened to me.

497
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:33,206
And the reason why I
love my company so much

498
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,759
is because of the value we provide,

499
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,594
and people buy our products every day

500
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:38,833
because they trust us.

501
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,931
F Corp is not only the
best thing in my life.

502
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:43,341
It's the best thing in everyone's lives,

503
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,511
but it could also be
the cause of our undoing

504
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,847
if I'm not careful.

505
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:51,724
So you see my dilemma here.

506
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:57,021
Tyrell, I pledge to you right now

507
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,732
that if you go with Allsafe,

508
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,954
the worst will never happen.

509
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:07,791
And how can you be so sure?

510
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:12,704
Because I've seen what
can happen to your company,

511
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:16,374
and I know how to prevent it.

512
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,878
You've seen what can
happen to my company?

513
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,548
Yes.

514
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,049
If you look through our packets,

515
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,801
we've created predictive models

516
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,386
for every possible attack vector...

517
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,889
No, no, Elliot.

518
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:34,499
I just wanna know you're on my side.

519
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,544
Always.

520
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,941
Come on, son.

521
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:46,946
You just landed the biggest
fish there is... F Corp.

522
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,707
Celebrate!

523
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,669
Did you bring it?

524
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,368
A signed first-edition copy,

525
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,796
just like you asked.

526
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,892
_

527
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,392
_

528
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:14,858
Shoot.

529
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,770
I need to make sure Angela
isn't home when I drop it off.

530
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,572
I think her mom's there.

531
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,615
Hello?

532
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,876
Emily?

533
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,133
You there?

534
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,959
Weird.

535
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,595
She picked up and
then she hung up on me.

536
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:46,362
I bet she's with Angela

537
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:49,132
and doesn't want to spoil the surprise.

538
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,894
Come on.

539
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:52,437
Let's order. I'm hungry.

540
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,725
Forgot my wallet.

541
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,812
Must have left it at home this morning.

542
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:02,614
That's not like you.

543
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,067
Must be nerves.

544
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,365
Okay.

545
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,825
Here you go.

546
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,419
You should buy her some flowers, too.

547
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,547
But first, we feast.

548
00:49:24,596 --> 00:49:26,051
So you'll be gone for a while?

549
00:49:26,054 --> 00:49:27,270
I already told you.

550
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:29,682
Why do you keep asking me?

551
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:31,685
No reason.

552
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,270
What are you up to?

553
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,490
Nothing.

554
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,930
You're up to something. I can tell.

555
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:41,557
Trust me.

556
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,254
I trust you.

557
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:45,101
I just don't believe you.

558
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,687
Your parents in town yet?

559
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,799
Uh, yeah, they were just at my place.

560
00:49:51,802 --> 00:49:54,022
I had to cancel lunch with
them because of work. Why?

561
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,200
Your dad sure loves to drink.

562
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,869
What's that?

563
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,537
Never mind.

564
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:06,044
Hey, I'm sorry I was
acting weird this morning.

565
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:09,575
Just really excited about tomorrow.

566
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:12,004
What's tomorrow, again?

567
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:15,342
Mm.

568
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,383
What could it be?

569
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:20,657
Well, I have a new Pilates instructor

570
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,030
I want you to try out.

571
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,061
I'm not a big Pilates guy.

572
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:26,552
Oh, we're trying that new sushi place

573
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:27,963
in Chelsea finally?

574
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:30,786
Getting warmer.

575
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:34,352
We're finally getting married.

576
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:37,682
