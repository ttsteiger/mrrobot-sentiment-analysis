1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,299
If they show up and we're
gone, my family's dead.

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:12,285
My life puts everyone I love in danger.

3
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,028
My instructions were
to find your brother.

4
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,352
Well, in that case, my phone's
not gonna do you any good.

5
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:21,050
I just wiped it.

6
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,349
Do you think it's possible

7
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:31,178
Mr. Robot is the reason
why you can't remember?

8
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:33,366
You didn't exist when
I was a kid, did you?

9
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,201
- Shh.
- Do not do this to him!

10
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,869
He's not supposed to know!

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,687
Why were you afraid of your father?

12
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,480
Were you afraid he was going to ask you

13
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,783
to do something you didn't want to do?

14
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,240
Yes.

15
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:47,036
This was our runaway
hideout. He always came here.

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,476
Remember somehow we ended up
at the Queens Museum instead?

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,885
When you're eight,
running away can be fun.

18
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:08,842
20, 19, 18,

19
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:15,724
17, 16, 15,

20
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:22,456
14, 13, 12...

21
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,300
What?

22
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,195
Who cares what I'm doing?

23
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:36,471
It's none of your business.
Don't worry about it.

24
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,604
I gotta do this. It's gonna help us.

25
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:46,940
Just trust me.

26
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,999
Ready or not, here I come!

27
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,871
Angela's not gonna find us here.

28
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:08,336
Just give me a sec.

29
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,718
I heard that!

30
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,455
You suck at this game!

31
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,007
I see you, butthead!

33
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,741
I killed him.

34
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,594
I killed him.

35
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,706
Okay, Elliot, we need
to call the police.

36
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,920
His phone's ringing.

37
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,190
Oh, God.

38
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,099
The others are coming
back. Did you hear me?

39
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,394
We're not safe in this place anymore!

40
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:48,937
Elliot, you gotta listen to me.

41
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,726
Listen to me. You gotta
listen to me, Elliot.

42
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,534
We have to go. Elliot, we have to go!

43
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:56,560
We have to leave, Elliot.
You have to get up.

44
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,955
Elliot!

45
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:02,450
Elliot!

46
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,785
Elliot, look at me.

47
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,920
Elliot! Elliot!

48
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:10,630
Elliot! Elliot!

49
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,979
Yo, make it plain.

50
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,007
Yo, he's not picking up, bro,

51
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,354

52
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,597
Man, I told you

53
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,436
at the Arby's up around the way, bro.

54
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,562
I'm not sitting on no
dirty-ass toilet seat, bro.

55
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,516
You know they be
getting hep C up they ass

56
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,735
in they pores and shit
sitting on that toilet, bro?

57
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:31,497
Man, I'm... I'm going inside, bro.

58
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,258
Yo, yo.

59
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,261
Boss told us stay
here till he done, son.

60
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:37,823
Bro, I'm gonna be quiet.

61
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:40,697
Yo, you don't wanna know
what's going on up there?

62
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,583
Come on, bro.

63
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,677
That was some cliff-hanger
shit they left us on.

64
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,512
Yeah, man. Come on, bro.

65
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,763
Yo, Arby's be delicious, though.

66
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,856
Got that five for five.

67
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:04,029
Shit's the fiscally responsible meal.

68
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,659
Man, I don't care about fiscally.

69
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:07,839
When it come to food,

70
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,392
I'm treating myself, man, period.

71
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:12,186
- Yo, you ever had Momofuku?
- Nah, see?

72
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,855
Yeah, you probably can't afford that.

73
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:17,042
I ain't never had Momofukus, bro.

74
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,211
I don't even know what that shit be.

75
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,760
You know what that shit be?

76
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,915
Oh, shit, bro!

77
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,167
What the fuck?

78
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,253
Oh, sh...

79
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,906
What are you doing, dummy?

80
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,658
Grab his wallet. Let's go.

81
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,662
Fuck.

82
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,749
Okay, come on.

83
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,158
We're gonna just get in this taxi.

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,752
Let's go. You're just fine.

85
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,194
Thank you. Just hold the taxi.

86
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,088
Come on, let's go. We gotta go.

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,256
Gotta go. It's okay.

88
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,700
I got you. There you go.

89
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,594
All right.

90
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,726
Okay, take us to the nearest
police station, please.

91
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,127
The nearest police station.

92
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,302
From everyone here at the E Corp family

93
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:28,021
to you and yours,

94
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,580
we're wishing you a
happy holiday season...

95
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:35,767
Slapjack!

96
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,491
Nuh-uh, my hand was there first.

97
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:39,441
Doesn't matter. I
called it first, doofus.

98
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,443
Don't call me doofus, dingus.

99
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,445
All right, all right. Official ruling.

100
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,963
You each get half the cards.

101
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,799
- But, Aunt Trudie...
- No buts.

102
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,467
I am the referee.

103
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,732
It's not fair.

104
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,303
Well, that's the way it's gotta be.

105
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,805
You're splitting the baby.

106
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,881
You can split my dick hole!

107
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:58,418
Thomas Alan DiPierro, you
apologize this instant!

108
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,978
- But, Mom...
- Now, young man,

109
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,689
or I'm taking your iPad.

110
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,317
Sorry, Aunt Trudie.

111
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,427
Now you go take a
time-out in the living room

112
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,272

Did you know that cities
were created by lightning?

135
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,066
It's true.

136
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,735
I heard it on a podcast.

137
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:34,573
Villages used to be made
of organic materials.

138
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,909
Mostly mud, sticks.

139
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,821
Then one night about 12,000 years ago,

140
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:44,566
a bolt of lightning hit
a chunk of limestone...

141
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,922
Which formed a powder
that we now know is...

142
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,198
Anyone?

143
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,840
Cement?

144
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:05,011
Very smart, Darlene.

145
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,589
You're absolutely right.

146
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,424
Just think what a
different world it would be

147
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:12,135
if that lightning had struck a tree

148
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:14,947
or a puppy instead.

149
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,782
This remarkable city you see before you

150
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,384
would be nothing but
sticks and leaves and...

151
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,104
Puppy shit.

152
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,031
But the lightning hit stone,

153
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,443
and the people of Turkey
awoke to find that they

154
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:32,906
were in the cradle of
modern civilization,

155
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:38,470
all from one perfect moment
of violent convergence.

156
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,972
Isn't it wonderful?

157
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,415
Destruction can be so productive.

158
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,885
Her phone is useless.
There's nothing here.

159
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,887
She wiped it clean.

160
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,561
I had hoped for better news.

161
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,806
I told you you were wasting your time.

162
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,901
Looks like you're just
going to have to restore

163
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,903
your phone for us yourself.

164
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,739
Eat shit. Then die.

165
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,759
Oh, nasty mouth on this one.

166
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,114
She doesn't know anything.

167
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,175
And even if she did, she
wouldn't give her brother up.

168
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,701
Trust me.

169
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:21,955
Well, I wish I could, Dominique,

170
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,176
but you failed me, remember?

171
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,259
Of course, I always held
out hope that you would rise

172
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:27,794
to the occasion when the time came,

173
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,212
but in the back of my mind,

174
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:32,006
I always knew you'd never
be able to see it through.

175
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,716
Why? Because I'm not a murderer?

176
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,137
You work for the federal government

177
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,181
of the United States of America.

178
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:43,184
What are you, trying to be funny?

179
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,186
No, what I meant was
is we all know how much

180
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,021
you care about Darlene.

181
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,876
What?

182
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,027
The hell are you talking about?

183
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,489
Oh, you know.

184
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,866
Miss Alderson's interrogation video?

185
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,994
The one you pleasure yourself to?

186
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,631
In private?

187
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,167
I mean, all that excess
energy may be the reason

188
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,803
you can't get any sleep, Dominique,

189
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:10,978
but in any case,

190
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,292
it's pretty strong evidence

191
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,974
of your affection for Miss Alderson,

192
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,642
wouldn't you say?

193
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,244
Oh, I'm so sorry.

194
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,900
Did she not know?

195
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,865
Uh, that is...

196
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,576
Embarrassing.

197
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,620
Um, I apologize.

198
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,955
But...

199
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,708
While we're at it...

200
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:54,773
What did happen between the two of you?

201
00:12:54,775 --> 00:13:00,854
I mean, it just all
seemed quite... dramatic.

202
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,031
We fucked, end of story.

203
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:15,095
Mm, come on, now.

204
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,615
I have a feeling there's a lot more

205
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:18,779
to this relationship than just that.

206
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,743
Just sex.

207
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:26,646
Sorry to disappoint you.

208
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,051
I don't believe you,
so... no worries there.

209
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:37,757
Disappointment averted.

210
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,987
Look, cunt stick.

211
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,156
I don't know what you're driving at,

212
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,658
but there's no way I'm
giving up my brother,

213
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,103
so whatever you're gonna do to me,

214
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:53,106
you might as well make it fast.

215
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:01,173
Okay.

216
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,159
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,787
I wouldn't take it out if I were you.

218
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,300
I am not a doctor,

219
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,853
but I am 99% sure I punctured a lung.

220
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,932
Yeah, that wheezing
sound is her chest cavity

221
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,008
filling up with air,

222
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,678
slowly compressing her lung.

223
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,755
You pull it out now,

224
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:26,865
it'll just supercharge the process.

225
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,481
She's got about 15
minutes before she goes

226
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:32,370
into full cardiac arrest
or drowns in her own blood.

227
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,647
Maybe longer,

228
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,571
since Dominique's such a fighter.

229
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,104
What was the fucking point?

230
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:39,517
She has nothing to do with this.

231
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,225
You said you would never
give up your brother.

232
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,432
I simply thought this would
be the most expeditious way

233
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,866
to break our stalemate.

234
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,868
You give us what we want,

235
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,996
we'll get Dominique the
care she so urgently needs.

236
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,998
Or she'll die here.

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,226
I'll just have to get it
out of you some other way.

238
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,732
Does that make sense?

239
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,823
Elliot, you have to come in with me.

240
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,191
I can't do this.

241
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,444
I can't do it.

242
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:23,075
Okay.

243
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,339
Okay.

244
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,304
What do people do?

245
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,541
People like me,

246
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,061
when then they find out
about something like this...

247
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,807
What can they do?

248
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:46,820
They just try to keep going.

249
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,034
I should have fought him.

250
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,536
If I... if I would have...
if I would have fought him,

251
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,475
maybe... maybe it would have stopped.

252
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,372
Look at me.

253
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,116
You were just a child.

254
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:13,162
It wasn't up to you.

255
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,311
I wanna go back to forgetting.

256
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,317
You never did forget.

257
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,765
You may not realize it now,

258
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:34,433
but you've been struggling
with this for years.

259
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:40,332
The itch in the back of your mind,

260
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,985
the one you can't scratch?

261
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,153
It's always there.

262
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,447
You just didn't know what it was.

263
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,177
But now you do.

264
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,190
He made me feel special.

265
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,195
You are special,

266
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:14,056
and what he did is... it's not
gonna take that away from you.

267
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,481
You will survive this, Elliot.

268
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,960
Call you tomorrow, okay?

269
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,073
No, no, I'm sorry...

270
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,377
I'm sorry I got you
involved in any of this.

271
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,808
You don't... you don't have
to take care of me anymore.

272
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,145
I'd like to see you again.

273
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,147
You shouldn't go through this alone.

274
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,491
I know.

275
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:09,662
I know.

276
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,338
Promise me you'll take care of yourself.

277
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,192
Where are we going?

278
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:27,073
You sick fuck!

279
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,575
She needs help. She is dying over there.

280
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,122
Oh, I'm aware.

281
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,446
I want nothing more than to
get her to our medical team

282
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:37,250
- and have her stitched up ASAP.
- Bullshit.

283
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:39,085
Even if I gave you Elliot's location,

284
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,494
you would just let her die.

285
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,122
That couldn't be further from the truth.

286
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:45,666
I'm not saying it's been all
blue skies with Dominique,

287
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:49,462
but most of our moles have
some growing pains at first,

288
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,265
and she is honest, loyal,
and she loves her family,

289
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:55,151
all of which are qualities
that make her easy to control.

290
00:19:57,638 --> 00:20:01,157
No, Dominique has pluck.

291
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,644
Losing her is the last thing I want.

292
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:08,039
Don't do it.

293
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,283
Don't tell her anything.

294
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,546
See?

295
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:19,717
I knew you two shared
a special connection.

296
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,961
Even now, I can sense it.

297
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:24,347
It's like a kind of...

298
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,600
Phantom electricity.

299
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,021
I wonder, did Dominique ever
introduce you to her mother?

300
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,715
Can't say she did.

301
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:37,569
Oh, that's too bad.
Trudie is my favorite.

302
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,013
You know, at first, I
thought our relationship

303
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:43,074
would be purely tactical.

304
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,098
Isolate the mark, ingratiate yourself,

305
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:47,186
find a pain point...
you know, the usual.

306
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:49,155
But then I got to know her,

307
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:53,585
and she is just so lovely and kind.

308
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,445
Every other word out of her
mouth is about you, Dominique.

309
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,740
She is so desperate
for you to find someone

310
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,243
that she even looked to
me as a potential match.

311
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:04,304
Can you imagine that?

312
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,474
I was so flattered.

313
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:11,544
You really have to admire
a mother who cares so much

314
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,927
about her daughter's
happiness that she's willing

315
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,350
to ignore certain red flags.

316
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:20,278
Like what, the fact that
you're fucking insane?

317
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,429
Mm.

318
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:25,432
You know, when I was in high school,

319
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,694
my parents discovered my
profound interest in taxidermy.

320
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:30,622
They had similar concerns,

321
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,983
so they had me undergo
a series of tests,

322
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,702
but the results were
always underwhelming.

323
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:38,779
No signs of personality disorder,

324
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:42,575
no unusual thought processes.

325
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:46,137
All the doctors arrived
at the same conclusion.

326
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:55,063
That I'm remarkably normal.

327
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,425
You wouldn't be fucking
doing this if you were normal.

328
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:00,726
She can't breathe over there.

329
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:03,262
Because of you.

330
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,398
Let's remember that.

331
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,456
I see this is causing
you a lot of grief.

332
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:15,862
I didn't want that.

333
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:18,077
I honestly thought we
would have moved on by now.

334
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,173
Let me continue to help you.

335
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,184
What are you doing?

336
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,461
I'm making a phone call
to our surveillance team

337
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:36,762
outside your mother's house.

338
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:38,264
Why?

339
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,357
Because I'm going to start

340
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,175
killing your family members.

341
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,298
Janice, please don't.

342
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,638
- There are 13 of them.
- Janice!

343
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Four children...

344
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:52,979
eight adults, and Trudie.

345
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:55,711
Don't! They're innocent, Janice! Please!

346
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:58,484
I wonder how many of them
have to die before you buckle.

347
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:01,621
Please, Janice, don't!

348
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:03,548
Please!

349
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,866
Do not do this.

350
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,793
Please don't!

351
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,828
Stop!

352
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:13,666
Stop.

353
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,635
Okay, hand me my phone.

354
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:24,718
I'll give you my brother's location.

355
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,239
I'll do whatever you
want. Just don't hurt them.

356
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,190
Now look who has pluck.

357
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:39,560
Why did you bring me
here? I don't get it.

358
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,364
What are you trying to say?

359
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,495
That I couldn't stand up to him?

360
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:01,582
That I ran away here instead?

361
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,340
I'm sorry I let him
do those things to you.

362
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,511
I'm sorry I didn't fight back.

363
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:19,934
I'm sorry I didn't protect you.

364
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:24,647
I'm sorry I didn't protect you.

365
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:30,027
I am so fucking sorry!

366
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:40,455
That isn't why I brought you here.

368
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,568
This sign.

369
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:36,594
It used to be over there.

370
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:56,689
Can you help me?

371
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:47,147
This is the key to my old bedroom.

372
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:56,081
Why would I hide it here?

373
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,676
It was Dad's key to our room.

374
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,163
We took it from him

375
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:04,831
so we could lock him out.

376
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,351
We thought that if he
didn't have his key...

377
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,521
He wouldn't be able to
come in and hurt us anymore.

378
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:16,677
That's right.

379
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:21,807
We hid the key

380
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,144
so the monster couldn't get to us.

381
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:36,622
Don't you see?

382
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,668
You're wrong.

383
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,623
This wasn't running away from him.

384
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,536
I was fighting back.

385
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,917
Location checks out.

386
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,892
Alderson's phone was
here, but he's gone.

387
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:08,020
Well, then where is he?

388
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,507
We're not sure yet.

389
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,212
There's a dead body, but it's not him.

390
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,735
Thank you.

391
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:23,869
He wasn't there, Darlene.

392
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,723
That doesn't make any sense.

393
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,251
You're right. It doesn't.

394
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:34,046
I gave you access to his location.

395
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,941
We tracked him on my phone.
You saw it for yourself.

396
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,582
You're gonna have to find another way.

397
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,210
There is no other way.

398
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,398
If he wasn't there, I
don't know what to say.

399
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,935
I mean, look,

400
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,957
my brother doesn't tell me anything.

401
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,777
Okay, if he's not with
his phone, it's because...

402
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,489
either something happened to him

403
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,146
or he doesn't want me
to know where he is.

404
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,281
You're lying.

405
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,098
Are you serious? I'm not lying.

406
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,118
Yes, you are. You are
a filthy lying liar.

407
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,472
Oh, my God.

408
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,625
She doesn't know.

409
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,296
She doesn't know where her brother is.

410
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:18,816
She's telling the truth.

411
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,353
Trust me.

412
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,427
I know what it looks
like when she's lying.

413
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,349
This isn't it. It's a dead end.

414
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:36,650
You know, maybe you're right.

415
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,911
Like my mother used to say:

416
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:42,948
you can't juice the orange
when there's only the rind left.

417
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:47,753
- Give me my phone.
- What are you doing?

418
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:50,664
I'm gonna have my men
gut Trudie like a trout.

419
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,873
What? Why?

420
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,019
Only way to confirm
or deny her statement.

421
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,021
No, I gave you my brother's location.

422
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,689
I did what you wanted me to do.

423
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,026
Correction: you gave
me his phone's location,

424
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,861
not his location.

425
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,354
No, no. Think about it, Janice.

426
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:07,633
My family's all you've
got. If you kill them now...

427
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:10,201
Then I'll have nothing
left to hang over your head.

428
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:13,019
- No!
- I know.

429
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:16,356
Looks like we both have a
lot riding on this, Dominique.

430
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,210
You know, in poker,

431
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,821
they would call this an all-in move.

432
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:24,990
You fucking moron.

433
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:27,033
You're doing this for no reason.

434
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,036
- I don't know where he is.
- And I'm calling your bluff.

435
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,206
Please, Janice, please.
We can work something out.

436
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,875
- Please.
- I'm sorry, Dominique.

437
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,393
I held off as long as I could.

438
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,901
No answer.

439
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,405
What?

440
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,877
Your men.

441
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,929
Are they not answering?

442
00:32:55,308 --> 00:33:00,023
And why exactly... would
you be asking me that?

443
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:05,090
Probably wanna ask him.

444
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,299
Him? Who's him?

445
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,395
Check my phone.

446
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:12,823
He's probably been trying to call me.

447
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:39,884
_

448
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,848
Dom, love, I've been
waiting for your call.

449
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,107
Hello?

450
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,276
Sorry for the delay,
but your plan worked.

451
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,312
The license plates you
gave me checked out.

452
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,873
Don't worry. Everything's grand.

453
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,951
I've got your family and we're
on our way to the safe house.

454
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:07,861
Who's this?

455
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,487
Who the fuck is this?

456
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,197
I asked you first.

457
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,791
This is Deegan. Who's this?

458
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:15,076
This is Janice.

459
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:18,632
Oh, yeah. The Dark Army lass.

460
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:20,768
Listen, tell Dom thanks
for the technicality.

461
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,499
We're square now.

462
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:25,470
Oh, and I'm really
sorry about your boys.

463
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:27,547
What do you mean? What boys?

464
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,382
The fellas guarding Dom's mum's house.

465
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:31,551
I had to give 'em a bit
of a holy show back there.

466
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:33,887
There weren't no other way.

467
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,982
What? Speak English!

468
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:39,225
I fucking killed 'em, dear.

469
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,486
Shot 'em in the brains.

470
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:42,948
With me gun.

471
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,082
Don't worry, though.
They died with dignity.

472
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,992
Well, a few of them might
have shat themselves,

473
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:48,252
but I believe that's
what the Frenchies call

474
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,236
de rigueur, innit?

475
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,405
Mr. Deegan,

476
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:55,104
I don't think you
have taken into account

477
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:59,871
the primal forces you
are meddling with here.

478
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,539
If you proceed down this path,

479
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,767
I will use every means at my disposal

480
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,521
- to make sure that you nev...
- Yeah, yeah.

481
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:07,015
I heard it all before. Take a number.

482
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,334
Et cetera and so forth.

483
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:11,883
Now you have yourself a
merry little Christmas.

484
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:14,886
Ta-ta for now, you flange.

485
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:51,315
You're okay.

486
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,058
You're okay.

487
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:57,137
- What do I do?
- Give me the phone.

488
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:12,152
I have a 10-13.

489
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:15,247
Officer needs immediate assistance.

490
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:19,993
202 West 20th street.

491
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:22,179
Apartment 16B.

492
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,997
Go.

493
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,185
What?

494
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,295
You can't be here when they arrive.

495
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:32,130
No, I am not leaving you like this.

496
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:33,559
I don't give a shit if they arrest me.

497
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:35,277
Don't be stupid.

498
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,511
This is all my fault. I did this to you.

499
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,183
You wanna help me?

500
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:48,688
Go find Elliot and take them down.

501
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,477
Hey, kiddo.

502
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:04,639
Uh, sorry for the time-out.

503
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,558
We're almost good to go.

504
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,643
Darlene's got everything we need

505
00:38:08,645 --> 00:38:11,622
to grab the Deus Group phone numbers

506
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:15,209
and intercept the 2FA codes.

507
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,279
And I'm working on a script

508
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:21,507
to transfer all the money.

509
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,784
Uh, but we don't have long.

510
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,452
Meeting's in an hour.

511
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,134
That's not why you
let me back in, is it?

512
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,520
Wanna talk about it?

513
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,528
Mind if I talk, then?

514
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:55,207
The only reason I'm here...

515
00:38:57,777 --> 00:38:59,986
Is to make sure no one ever hurts you.

516
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,784
That was supposed to
be your father's job,

517
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,387
but he failed.

518
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:12,349
He was too weak.

519
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,939
But you...

520
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,734
You were strong.

521
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:26,804
You fought back...

522
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,891
The only way you could.

523
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:36,314
You brought me here to protect you...

524
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,732
from him.

525
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,716
I tried to keep you safe...

526
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:49,410
Only show you the memories

527
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:52,222
when the two of you
were friends before...

528
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:00,755
I thought I could...

529
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:05,736
store the truth so you'd
never have to see it...

530
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,347
or feel it.

531
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:15,728
The fact is...

532
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:19,941
I didn't wanna see it either.

533
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,332
I made a terrible mistake.

534
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,705
I was afraid...

535
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,461
Afraid of what this would do to you...

536
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,441
To us.

537
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,995
This was never my secret to keep.

538
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:01,774
And you deserved better than
to live in darkness for so long.

539
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,741
I'm so sorry.

540
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,548
I failed you too.

541
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,636
I understand if you
can't forgive me or...

542
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,850
If you decide to shut me out for good...

543
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:44,984
Just as long as you know...

544
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,582
I am not your father.

545
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:55,995
I never was.

546
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:05,688
I know.

547
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,526
You're nothing like him.

548
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,846
That's why I created you.

549
00:42:16,476 --> 00:42:18,034
You're the father I needed...

550
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,147
Not the father I had.

551
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:36,961
If I could have stopped him...

552
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,835
If I could go back in time,

553
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:47,505
change everything
that happened to you...

554
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:49,090
make it all go away...

555
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,515
Then I wouldn't be me.

556
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:15,867
And I wouldn't have you.

557
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,447
I don't know if I can go
through with the hack anymore.

558
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:43,269
I don't know if I can do anything.

559
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:05,141
I can't do it.

560
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:11,172
I can't do it.

561
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,927
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

562
00:44:20,683 --> 00:44:22,642
I can't do it.

563
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:32,836
I can't do it.
