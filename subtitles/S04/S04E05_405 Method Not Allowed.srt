1
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,118
- Get in.
- What about him?

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,511
He's dead.

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,687
- Krista.
- Leave me alone.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,773
She our girl.

5
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,389
She knows something I gotta know.

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,352
We are very pleased that
you are back to work.

7
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:20,834
Let us know if there's
anything you need,

8
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:21,865
and we'll do the same.

9
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:24,143
He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen.

10
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:26,467
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,991
Whiterose loses everything.

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,679
I got into Olivia's Cyprus
National Bank account.

13
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,278
I can see all the Deus account numbers,

14
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,641
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything,

15
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,394
which means we are gonna have
to break into Virtual Realty

16
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:38,946
and get on their servers.

17
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,412
Schedule the meeting for tomorrow.

18
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,449
There's no way we'll be
able to get the Deus Group

19
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,450
together so quickly.

20
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:44,604
I have lost everyone.

21
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,403
The only one I have left is my brother,

22
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,471
who treats me like absolute shit,

23
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:50,407
but I'm really worried
about him right now.

24
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,177
I'm afraid he might be dead.

25
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,706
Tyrell.

26
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,256
Burn the van and all the evidence.

27
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,914
It's cool, dude.

28
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,834
We don't have to talk.
