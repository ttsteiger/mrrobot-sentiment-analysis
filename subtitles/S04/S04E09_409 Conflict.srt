1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,728
‐ I'm a mercenary.
I don't play fair.

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:13,046
I would rather see you lose
than win myself.

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,982
‐ The Deus Group.
‐ We can take them all down.

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,350
‐ Just need
their phone numbers.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,351
Get them all
in a room together.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,819
‐ I'm resigning.

7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,754
‐ We've been waiting for
Elliot Alderson's next move,

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,356
and this could be it.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,892
‐ We will not wait for them
to make a mistake.

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,027
Arrange a Deus Group meeting
to confirm a successor...

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,529
Wellick.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,632
‐ Make sure you take care
of Whiterose.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,568
‐ We got the access we needed

14
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,503
to transfer the money
from the bank's site.

15
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,905
We can rob them blind.

16
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:38,906
‐ This is all my fault.

17
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,374
‐ You want to help me?

18
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,509
Go find Elliot,
and take them down.

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,077
‐ I own everything.

20
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,913
Every bribe,
blackmail, extortion‐‐

21
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,881
everything will go public.

22
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,017
‐ Mr. Alderson,
he's too much of a liability.

23
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,286
‐ If we kill him, his shipping
hack dies with him.

24
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,389
It's time he learns
we're on the same side.

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,391
‐ See? They all came back.

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,092
Everyone's okay again.

27
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,528
‐ Angela, whatever Whiterose
told you is a lie.

28
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,730
‐ I know it's possible.
I've seen it.

29
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,999
‐ I don't know if I can go
through with the hack anymore.

30
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,334
‐ Look at me.

31
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,605
I am not the one
Darlene talked to.

32
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,673
‐ You shouldn't be
sitting there.

33
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,874
That's not your seat.

34
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,509
‐ Why?
‐ They're not ready yet,

35
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,877
so we need to wait.

36
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,835
‐ How is he?

37
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,205
‐ It's not going
to happen today.

38
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,774
There's no point
in waiting here now.

39
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,748
‐ We aren't going anywhere.

40
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,584
You know where he is.
You need to bring him here.

41
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,320
‐ It's not that simple.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,589
We're gonna have to help him
through this.

43
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,559
‐ Mom.

44
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,863
Maybe we should just
tell him now...

45
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,834
About everything.

46
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,040
Then Elliot will be okay.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,108
Right?

48
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,047
‐

49
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,724
I'm telling you.

50
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,126
He's not ready.

51
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,329
‐ When will he be ready?

52
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,666
You've let this
go on far too long.

53
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,301
‐ It's a little more
complicated than that.

54
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,803
I didn't know
everything that was happening.

55
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,571
‐ That's a lie.

56
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,006
You've been part of these
shenanigans from the beginning.

57
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:26,940
You encourage it.

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,810
‐ Okay, okay.
Just stop.

59
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,746
Yes, I'll admit it.

60
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,881
I did.

61
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,683
I never thought
he'd take things this far.

62
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,753
There's nothing I can do now.

63
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,689
‐ Just talk to him.

64
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,925
‐ We have to finish
his mission.

65
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,293
Once the hack is done,

66
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:50,197
maybe then
I can get through to him.

67
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,032
‐ And how are you
gonna do that?

68
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,704
‐ I'm gonna show him
what he did.

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,214
‐ And if it doesn't work?

70
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,150
‐

71
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,521
We can't go on like this.

72
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,292
And that poor boy.

73
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,962
We may lose him forever.

74
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,597
For God's sake,
he hasn't woken up since‐‐

75
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,132
‐ That's not true.

76
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,303
Darlene.

77
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,274
She said they talked
two months ago.

78
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,042
He woke up for her...

79
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,382
Which means she might be
the one who could help us.

80
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,453
‐ Great. You decided to show.

81
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,458
‐ I know.
You weren't expecting me.

82
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,562
But I'm here for Elliot,
same as you.

83
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,731
What can you expect
after what happened?

84
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,767
Life throws you
an error code like that,

85
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,270
you don't have the luxury of
a fucking pop‐up explanation.

86
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,272
So what are you
supposed to do?

87
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,241
Move on without answers,

88
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,644
or stay down and drive
yourself crazy with questions?

89
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,315
That's where Elliot is‐‐
mired in conflict.

90
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,050
And that's why I'm here.

91
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,786
How we doing?

92
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,789
‐ Got line of sight on the IMSI
catcher to the front door.

93
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,958
Deus members
should be arriving soon.

94
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,228
Where the fuck have you been?

95
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,897
‐ Got held up.

96
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,032
‐ What kind of answer is that?

97
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,500
You had me worried.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,502
I told you the Dark Army
is looking for you.

99
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,238
‐ The day didn't go
exactly as planned.

100
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:14,841
Cut me some slack, okay?
Things went a little sideways.

101
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,011
‐ Oh. Really?
Is that so?

102
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,014
Things went a little sideways
for you, huh?

103
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,782
You want to hear about
the fucking night I've had?

104
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,352
‐ This isn't a pissing contest,
sweetheart.

105
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,959
Let's just get back to work.

106
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,301
What the fuck are you doing?

107
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,539
‐ Why are you here?

108
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,009
Where is he?

109
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,677
‐

110
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,447
You don't want him
here right now.

111
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,716
‐ Why the fuck not?

112
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,552
‐ He just can't.
Not now.

113
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,490
‐ What happened to him?

114
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,496
‐ He'll be fine.
He just needs some time.

115
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,733
‐ I don't trust you.

116
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,834
‐ I don't need you to trust me.

117
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,037
I just need you
to help me pull this off.

118
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,239
‐ Tell me what's going on,
or I'm walking.

119
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,608
‐ I can't.

120
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,611
He needs to be
the one to tell you...

121
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,080
when he's ready.

122
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,331
What the fuck
are you doing here?

123
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,498
Do you realize
how risky this is?

124
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,968
What if someone saw you?

125
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,302
She's with me.

126
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,770
Out with it.
Why are you here?

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,905
You're supposed to be
across the street

128
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,273
with your Deus pals.

129
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,275
‐ There's one last thing
I need from you.

130
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,610
‐ Well, it's a little late in
the game to be making demands.

131
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,045
‐ It's‐‐

132
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,715
it's not a demand.

133
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,850
It's a favor.

134
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,920
‐ Given the danger you've put
us all in just by being here,

135
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,655
I hope it's worth it.

136
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,623
‐ It is.

137
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,731
‐ What's this?

138
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,571
‐ I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

139
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,141
Everything you need to know
about her project,

140
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,210
it's on here.

141
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,315
Promise me.

142
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,517
‐ After tonight,
she'll be ruined.

143
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,819
Why is this important to you?

144
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:47,093
‐ Because it was
important to Angela.

145
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,329
It's what she wanted.

146
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,401
‐ Okay.

147
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,469
I promise.

148
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,246
Remember,
you gotta keep everyone there

149
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,014
until we grab
their phone numbers.

150
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,683
Don't let anyone leave,
especially Whiterose.

151
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,460
‐ What was that about?

152
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,732
Hey.

153
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,170
What the hell does
Price know about Angela?

154
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,538
What is going on?

155
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,840
‐ I'll fill you in,
but right now,

156
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,009
we gotta get started.

157
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,045
We're already behind.

158
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,047
In order to rob
the Deus Group blind,

159
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,749
we need to get access
to transfer funds

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,851
from Cyprus National Bank.

161
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,388
To do that, we need every
Deus asshole's phone number.

162
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,457
Why?
Because Darlene can then match

163
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,892
each of those phone numbers
to its corresponding Cyprus

164
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,696
National Bank account number
and initiate a transfer.

165
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,231
Once she initiates
the transfer,

166
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,066
it'll trigger
a security 2FA code

167
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,769
that'll be texted to every
Deus dickhead's phone.

168
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,370
Then Darlene will run a script

169
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,306
to automatically grab
those 2FA codes,

170
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,907
and transfer all their money

171
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,743
before they have time
to stop it.

172
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,585
So, yeah, I'm worried.

173
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,721
For what, though,
I'm not sure.

174
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,423
But whatever it is...

175
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,595
It's coming.

176
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,841
‐ I can't believe Angela never
told me Price was her father.

177
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,882
‐ Maybe she didn't know.

178
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,555
‐ I miss her.

179
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,960
‐

180
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,295
Darlene, I‐‐

181
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,596
‐ No, I don't want
to talk about it.

182
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,266
I just...

183
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,334
I just wanted to say that.

184
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,808
‐ Okay.

185
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,356
Something's not right.

186
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,193
No one's gone in or out
of that building

187
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,195
other than Price.

188
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,036
‐ Wait,
you think they're onto us?

189
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,370
‐ I don't know.

190
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:58,117
‐ I see I'm the first
to arrive.

191
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,520
‐ Technically, I was first.

192
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,804
‐ You want to tell me
what's going on?

193
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,141
‐ I thought we'd start
with a drink.

194
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,746
‐ I'm an old man, Zhang.

195
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,049
I gave up on foreplay long ago.

196
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,451
Let's just skip
ahead to the part

197
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,786
where you try to fuck me.

198
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,859
‐ If they are onto us,

199
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,361
if the Deus Group
doesn't show,

200
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,562
everything's we've been
working on

201
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,031
will be a big fucking fail.

202
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,501
If Elliot were here,
what would he do?

203
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,038
He'd look for abnormalities,
incompatibilities,

204
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,441
anything that isn't adding up,
any conflicts.

205
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,709
‐ What are you doing?

206
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,910
‐ Looking.

207
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,580
‐ For?
‐ I don't know yet.

208
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,715
Elliot saved an image
of Tyrell's phone,

209
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,083
swiped all his credentials.

210
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,518
If Whiterose thought
something was up,

211
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,220
she would've told
the other members,

212
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,756
including the guy
she was having the meeting for.

213
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,562
‐ All you had to do
was nothing,

214
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,233
just sit idly by and wait
for the new year to arrive,

215
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,270
but you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

216
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,976
I wanted to let you live
into retirement‐‐

217
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,778
I planned on it‐‐

218
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,348
as a gift of sorts.

219
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,150
I guess you can say
I always get

220
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,787
swept up when it comes
to the holidays.

221
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,755
But then you had to be naughty.

222
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,991
‐ Come on, Zhang.

223
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,594
You know I've never been
the nice type.

224
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,131
‐ Let me drive.

225
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,966
Maybe his calendar.

226
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,972
‐ After your
abrupt resignation

227
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,442
and Mr. Alderson's
curious disappearance,

228
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,210
it wasn't hard to figure out
that you two

229
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,578
were working together.

230
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,047
Tell me Mr. Alderson's plan,

231
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,782
and these gentlemen
will take you home

232
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,118
and inject you with maitotoxin.

233
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,620
You will die in your sleep.

234
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,557
The papers will say
you passed from heart failure.

235
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,194
Sad, but painless.

236
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,364
Or, we could go the other way.

237
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,366
You're well aware
of our methods.

238
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,681
‐ So you canceled
the Deus Group meeting

239
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:46,352
based on this half‐cocked
conspiracy theory of yours.

240
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:52,392
This last‐minute change will
not sit well with the others.

241
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,761
‐ Downtown near Wall Street.

242
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,699
Hey, are you hearing this?

243
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,833
Let's move.
We gotta go.

244
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,034
Do‐or‐die time.

245
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,269
They're probably
already inside,

246
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,071
which means
we'll have to find a way in

247
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,207
to get a line of sight.

248
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,743
‐ Price didn't know
about the venue change.

249
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,045
‐ So what?

250
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,347
‐ Why didn't they tell him?

251
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,815
‐ I don't know.

252
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,117
He's persona non grata
on his way out.

253
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,886
Who gives a shit?

254
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,354
‐ Why the heavy
security detail?

255
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,688
Price is one guy.

256
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,457
If they wanted
to get rid of him,

257
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,060
they don't need a team
of Dark Army soldiers to do it.

258
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,237
They're not there
to kill Price.

259
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,706
They're there
to protect someone.

260
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,110
‐ The meeting is taking place
as we speak.

261
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,548
I'm sure Mr. Wellick,
the new CEO of E Corp,

262
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,951
is impressing everyone
with his smile.

263
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,786
Unfortunately,
I'll be uncharacteristically

264
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,121
late for the gathering,

265
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,023
but I'm sure
they'll understand.

266
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,092
‐ Will they?
Hmm.

267
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,462
I'd expect mutiny

268
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,664
when they realize
that Tyrell Wellick,

269
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,632
your guest of honor

270
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,769
and the sole purpose
for the meeting,

271
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,940
will not be in attendance.

272
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,447
‐ I'm gonna stay.

273
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,149
‐ What?

274
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,951
‐ You have the exploit
to verify the phone numbers

275
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,987
ready to go.

276
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,589
‐ No, we can't split up.

277
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,591
What if something else
goes wrong with the plan?

278
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,431
‐ You know,
it just occurred to me.

279
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,733
We've never gotten
drunk together, have we?

280
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,306
I think this might
be a good night to start.

281
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,478
What do you think?

282
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,948
‐ The plan is pointless
if we don't get Whiterose, too.

283
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,783
She's gotta be in there.
I have to stay.

284
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,152
‐ That makes no sense.
We only have one IMSI capture.

285
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,022
We need to do this together.
‐ We don't have a choice.

286
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,224
Now go.

287
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,196
‐ Mr. Wellick
is nowhere to be found.

288
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,797
We're still searching
the tri‐state area‐‐

289
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,299
‐ A waste of time.
Stop.

290
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,269
Tell them all to stop.

291
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,238
Is this part of your plan?

292
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,674
Mr. Wellick's
mysterious disappearance?

293
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,976
What did you do to him?

294
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,478
‐ Truthfully...

295
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,147
I have no idea
where Wellick is.

296
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,182
He may be dead.

297
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,517
Mm.

298
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,853
No, no, no.
Now I think of it,

299
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,422
he did mention
something about

300
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,358
wanting to travel
the great southwest

301
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,563
in a '65 El Camino convertible,

302
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,065
wind in his hair...

303
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,703
‐ He's beaten you!

304
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,473
You lost today.

305
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,108
Doesn't mean
we can't fight back tomorrow,

306
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,876
but right now,
we have to leave

307
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,779
and warn the Deus Group
before this gets worse.

308
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,215
‐ We are not going anywhere.

309
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,855
‐ If you won't
listen to reason,

310
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,724
then I'm done.

311
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,728
‐ Whoa.

312
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,173
It's bad management

313
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,143
when your best employees
either walk off the job,

314
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,013
or blow their brains out.

315
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,803
‐ Fuck am I gonna
get in there?

316
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,457
‐ Perimeter is secure.

317
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,459
Make sure
these doors stay locked

318
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,994
the rest of the evening.

319
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,864
‐ Goddamn. Christmas Day?
This better be good.

320
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,800
‐ Yeah, he's a dickwad,
but a total and complete

321
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,468
shutdown of Muslims
entering the United States...

322
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,971
‐ That runaround for
tonight's location details...

323
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,673
‐ Iraq's a proper mess.

324
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,075
Deus needs to get
its giant dick

325
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,876
out of that sand
sooner than later.

326
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,445
‐ Rousseff is fucked.

327
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,048
He did it to himself.
Or was that us?

328
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,783
‐ How are you, my friend?

329
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,953
‐ Just came off an 11‐hour
flight on Christmas Day.

330
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,255
‐ Ah.
‐ My wife is furious.

331
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,391
And my girlfriend?

332
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,094
She won't return
my phone calls.

333
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,830
Whatever Zhang
has planned better be good.

334
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,398
‐ Couldn't agree more.

335
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,068
‐ Evening, gentlemen.
Hors d'oeuvres?

336
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,138
‐ Speaking of,
where is our host?

337
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,217
‐ Back inside.

338
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,887
This entrance
is off limits tonight.

339
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,724
Go.

340
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,539
‐ There's no fucking way.

341
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,907
‐ Well?
Who is it?

342
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,150
Hello?

343
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,720
‐ That sure as hell
doesn't sound like Price.

344
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,022
‐ Mr. Alderson.

345
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,991
It's good to hear your voice.

346
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:15,494
I was hoping
we could talk in person.

347
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,497
‐ You once told me that we'd
never see each other again.

348
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,466
What makes you
want to see me now?

349
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,669
‐ Call it a change of mind.

350
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,271
A realization.

351
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,174
‐ Nah.

352
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,844
If I'm hearing your voice
on the other end of this call,

353
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,313
I'm good.

354
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:37,316
‐ And what does that mean?

355
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,817
‐ You'll know soon enough.

356
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,389
‐ A proposal.

357
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,457
You stop whatever it is
you're planning,

358
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,359
and I give you information
that will prove to be

359
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,328
very valuable to you.

360
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,230
‐ You think
I'm gonna trust you?

361
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,066
‐ Let me earn your trust
by sharing first.

362
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,635
It is about your friend...

363
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,304
Angela.

364
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,577
‐ What about her?
‐ You see, Elliot...

365
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,115
You think Angela's dead,

366
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,684
but she's not.

367
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,659
‐ You sent me a picture
of her dead body,

368
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,461
you sick fucking fuck.

369
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,165
‐ And you believe
what most people believe?

370
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,035
Only what is right
in front of you?

371
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,104
I expected more from you.

372
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,807
‐ You think I'm gonna believe
this bullshit?

373
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,576
You killed her.
Angela's dead.

374
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,878
‐ No, Elliot.

375
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,114
Angela's alive.

376
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,051
And if you allow me,

377
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,887
I can take you to her.

378
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,523
Would you like that, Elliot?

379
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,393
Would you like
to see Angela again?

380
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,463
To hear her voice?

381
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,232
To hold her hand?

382
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,811
Elliot, are you there?

383
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,725
‐ Yes.

384
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,865
‐ I know you have regrets,
Elliot,

385
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,300
and pain.

386
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,069
I know there are things
in your life

387
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,538
you wish were different,
just the same as Angela,

388
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,043
and I can show you a way that
you can make it all go away,

389
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,444
just as I did for her.

390
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,979
You can reset everything

391
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,081
and live in the world
you deserve,

392
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,117
a world without
all the pain you're carrying,

393
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,721
without your past,
without your regrets.

394
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,823
Please, Elliot.

395
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,092
Let me show you the world

396
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,095
that I showed
your closest friend.

397
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,506
‐ I saw what you did to her

398
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,775
before you killed her.

399
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,281
That wasn't Angela.
You used her.

400
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,983
You turned her
into someone else.

401
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,387
‐ Then don't take
my word for it.

402
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,323
Ask her yourself.

403
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,861
Elliot,

404
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:39,298
we don't have to fight
like this anymore.

405
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,134
Let's finally make peace
with each other,

406
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:45,504
as we were always meant to do.

407
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,742
Let go of the anger
and the hatred

408
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,845
you've built up towards me.

409
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,381
Understand I've only
wished to help.

410
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,451
‐ Here's the thing.

411
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,555
I don't need help right now.

412
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,591
You do.

413
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,972
‐ Good evening,
people of Earth.

414
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,874
We are fsociety.

415
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,742
We have risen from the ashes

416
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,545
to bring you
a Christmas miracle,

417
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:31,183
a miracle that will finally
reveal our true nemesis.

418
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,154
The secret club running
the world is the Deus Group,

419
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,989
a clandestine collection

420
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,825
of the world's richest
and most powerful people.

421
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,795
Deus Group, we know you,
and we know what you do.

422
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,232
And tonight, the whole world
will learn about you.

423
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,767
Most of you watching
have never heard

424
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,736
the name Deus Group.

425
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,438
That's because they've worked
hard to keep it that way.

426
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,041
To begin to understand
their reach,

427
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,611
to see the evil crimes
they're responsible for,

428
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,812
click on the link below

429
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,015
to download
all their private files.

430
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,051
And if you'd like to meet
the despicable individuals

431
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,220
who have co‐opted your lives
for profit,

432
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,722
come meet them now in person

433
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,526
while they wine and dine
at Cipriani.

434
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:19,097
I am sure
they'd appreciate the visit.

435
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,466
Deus Group,
you have been owned.

436
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,403
Fsociety and the world
will cheer

437
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,573
as we watch your black hearts
stop beating.

438
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,241
This is not a warning.

439
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,343
This is the beginning
of the end.

440
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,645
We are fsociety.

441
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,151
‐

442
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,961
‐ Hey.

443
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,295
‐ Did you see the video?

444
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,496
‐ Yeah.

445
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,364
‐ Hopefully,
that'll do the trick

446
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,866
to smoke these fuckers out.

447
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,668
Did you find Whiterose?

448
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,171
‐ Yeah.
I talked to her.

449
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,506
‐ You what?
Jesus Christ.

450
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,075
You were supposed
to hack her phone,

451
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,477
not call it.

452
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,479
‐ It was only for a second.

453
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,780
But it was Price's phone,

454
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,817
so we still need
to get Whiterose's number.

455
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,989
‐ Are you okay?

456
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,595
‐ I don't know.

457
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,031
I don't know anymore.

458
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,108
‐ Hey, Elliot?

459
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,850
I'm glad you're back.

460
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,400
‐ I gotta go.

461
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,601
‐ What happened?

462
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,735
‐ There's a cell tower.

463
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,304
If I can see traffic
on that tower‐‐

464
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,705
‐ No, I mean‐‐

465
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:10,342
‐ We can't get past her
security and into the hotel.

466
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,943
We need her phone number.

467
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,645
‐ Hey.

468
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,447
Are you gonna be okay?

469
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,381
‐ Only way this works
is if we hit their accounts

470
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,716
at the same time.

471
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,751
If the other members
get the 2FA codes first,

472
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,353
they'll alert Whiterose.

473
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,587
Just keep them
in your line of sight.

474
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,757
I'll let you know
when I've got it.

475
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,370
‐ Sergey,
you have to trust me.

476
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,707
We will get through this.
Everything will be all right.

477
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,109
Oh, don't listen
to that Mason.

478
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,478
The man is an absolute buffoon.

479
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,681
No, no, don't leave.
Don't go outside.

480
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,718
Tell everyone to remain,
Sergey.

481
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,427
Sergey?

482
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,795
Hello?

483
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,664
Hello?

484
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,338
So that's it.

485
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,606
So that's your big move!

486
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,975
You think that I can't survive
being doxxed?

487
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,244
‐ I have no idea.

488
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,614
I'm as curious as you.

489
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,149
‐ Hello?

490
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,673
‐

491
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,007
‐ Come on!

492
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,981
‐ I can't do anything about it.
Look. It's not working.

493
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,350
Obviously, it's not working.

494
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,004
Shit.
‐ Private event tonight.

495
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,807
You can't be here.
Everyone, back it up.

496
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,934
‐ A short time ago,
fsociety resurfaced

497
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,270
with a new video,
and while the contents

498
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,639
of that video remain
largely unconfirmed,

499
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,074
it focuses entirely

500
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,042
on an international
investment firm,

501
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,844
the Deus Group.

502
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,299
It's a collection of powerful
men whom fsociety claims

503
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,534
to be guilty
of international crimes,

504
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,504
and as you can see behind me,
onlookers have gathered

505
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,739
with hopes
of catching a glimpse

506
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,240
of any Deus Group members.

507
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,391
‐ Just got into
the cell tower.

508
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,666
‐ All this over a little
pipsqueak in a hoodie.

509
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,680
‐ Where are we at, kiddo?

510
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,748
‐ I've got a bunch of numbers.

511
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,250
I just can't tell
if any of them are hers.

512
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,287
‐ Truth be told,
I never liked Mr. Alderson‐‐

513
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:06,725
his anxious demeanor,
his juvenile anger.

514
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,560
But...

515
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,263
he does bring
something to the table‐‐

516
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,899
well, for me.

517
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,790
‐ Mr. Alderson
is the only person I believe

518
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,928
actually able to hurt you...

519
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,089
Truly hurt you.

520
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,528
And clearly,

521
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,763
you believe it, too.

522
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,914
‐ Come on.

523
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,555
‐ Why do we have to cut these
things so goddamn close?

524
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:09,013
‐ What are you doing?

525
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,017
‐ Peaceful out here.

526
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,155
Cold winter air.

527
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,171
‐ Are you really going to make
me force you into the car?

528
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,916
‐ You know, I almost
let myself believe you...

529
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,455
When you said Angela
was still alive.

530
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,357
I know what kind of conman
you are,

531
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,792
how you operate.

532
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,895
Even though I saw your men

533
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,098
drag her dead body away,

534
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,001
I still wanted to believe
what you were saying.

535
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,822
When you spoke
to Mr. Alderson,

536
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:29,227
I felt the power
of your promise.

537
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,504
And all I could think is,
well...

538
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:43,608
maybe that's what my daughter
thought when you came to her.

539
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,652
The desperation to have
all her pain go away,

540
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,088
to have her past rewritten‐‐

541
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,424
and that's why it works, right?

542
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,437
The one thing
every person has:

543
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,639
regret.

544
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,708
You weaponize that,

545
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,877
and then you use that weapon
against them

546
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,546
to destroy them.

547
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,881
But here's the thing
I've realized as of late.

548
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,817
With Angela‐‐

549
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,452
didn't work.

550
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,525
Angela lives on

551
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:38,496
in the lives
of the people who love her.

552
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,697
And that love...

553
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:44,969
that love fuels
their unwavering resolve

554
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,406
to turn the tables
to destroy you.

555
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:06,257
You just remember, Zhang.

556
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,327
You did all this to yourself.

557
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:16,834
‐ You should take
your own advice, Phillip.

558
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,303
Accept your truth.

559
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,208
It's over.

560
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,347
‐ Yeah.

561
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,883
Yes.

562
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,886
I suppose it is.

563
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,199
‐ It happened.

564
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:56,507
It actually happened.

565
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,645
‐ What?

566
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:04,015
‐ Something wrong, old sport?

567
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,986
‐ What is this?

568
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,323
‐ Well,
if it's what I think it is,

569
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,326
we're all broke.

570
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,628
‐ No.

571
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,665
That's impossible.

572
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,900
‐ Apparently not.

573
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,774
‐ Where is it, Phillip?

574
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,076
Where is my fucking money?

575
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,351
‐ Gone.

576
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,922
‐ No.
‐ I warned you.

577
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,326
I told you long ago.
I'm a mercenary.

578
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,662
I'd rather see you lose
than win myself.

579
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,064
‐ That can't be.
‐ Finally.

580
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:57,502
I found a way to take
what's most important to you.

581
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:59,704
‐ No, no.

582
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,940
‐ Your project,

583
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,343
your dream

584
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,479
of another world‐‐

585
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,982
it's as good as dead.

586
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,125
Think of it this way, Zhang.

587
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:25,196
You didn't lose the game.

588
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,999
You just ran out of time.

589
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:38,276
‐

590
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,664
‐ And like that...

591
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,700
Rome falls.

592
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,503
No more Deus Group.

593
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,507
No more top 1% of the top 1%.

594
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,378
No more controlling
every piece of our lives.

595
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:24,589
No more playing God
without permission.

596
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,424
We took them down.

597
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,327
All of them.

598
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,895
‐ FBI.
Open the door.

599
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:08,866
We have a warrant.

600
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,105
Minister Zhang,
we have a warrant.

601
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,475
FBI.

602
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,544
Open the door.

603
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,950
Minister Zhang,
come out.

604
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,586
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

605
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,594
Minister Zhang.

606
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,867
Minister Zhang,
we're coming in.

607
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:46,604
Three, two, one,
execute, execute, execute.
