1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:03,666
Mr. Alderson needs to
be kept on a short leash

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,095
and trained not to bite his master.

3
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:08,563
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

4
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:10,250
Whiterose loses everything.

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,448
You have to have a contact at the bank.

6
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,760
I need everything you
have on Susan Jacobs.

7
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:16,232
I'm in, whether you like it or not.

8
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,448
You want me to request

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,930
that the entire Deus Group
gather without even a pretext?

10
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,487
I'm resigning as CEO of E Corp.

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,180
I played my hand.

12
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:27,400
Now we wait.

13
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,359
Fernando Vera.

14
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,864
DJ, shoot the cocksucker.

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,865
When he showed up at your building

16
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:33,981
a couple months ago...

17
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,740
The CTO position is worthless.

18
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,228
When the time is right,
we'll expose them.

19
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:40,282
There's something about
this. I can feel it.

20
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:41,308
I know him.

21
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,143
I actually think he
might have been involved.

22
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:44,228
- Whiterose.
- Whiterose.

23
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,904
- Whiterose.
- Does the guy even exist?

24
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:46,986
Minister Zhang.

25
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:48,201
The official fucking bogeymen.

26
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:49,505
- State security.
- Whiterose.

27
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,804
Who is Whiterose?

28
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,497
IBM will pay to shareholders

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,189
a cash dividend of $22
UN per depository share,

30
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,379
and this payment will bring
the total annual cash dividend

31
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:08,550
to $44 UN per depository share.

32
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,824
And along with our purchase agreement,

33
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,905
we're also willing to offer
your government a discount

34
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,782

Excellent.

Uh...

49
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:58,033
the feeling is mutual.

50
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,290

124
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,575
Minister Zhang, it's
too early to celebrate.

125
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,152
We have a number of issues to discuss.

126
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,527
There's Freddy Lomax...

127
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,605
the cartoon character you call a lawyer

128
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,417
who committed suicide?

129
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,586
The person he met with escaped

130
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,905
after compromising Grand
Central's surveillance system.

131
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,241
And?

132
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,744
Gaining access to Grand
Central is no easy feat.

133
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:19,275
We've been waiting for
Elliot Alderson's next move,

134
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,052
and this could be it.

135
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,952
And the fact that this is coinciding

136
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:26,421
with Phillip Price's
abrupt resignation request?

137
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,275
Well, it's like you always say:

138
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,720
There is no such thing as a coincidence.

139
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,599
Very well.

140
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,581
Refuse Price's demands
and keep on digging.

141
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:42,583
Additionally,

142
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,899
keep constant surveillance
on Elliot Alderson.

143
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:50,629
We will figure this out, Minister Zhang.

144
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,615
It will just require some patience.

_

206
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,541
No.

207
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,129
Minister Zhang?

208
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,024
Did you say something?

209
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,655
Give Phillip Price what he wants.

210
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,582
I'm sorry?

211
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,849
Let him know that we will
arrange a Deus Group meeting

212
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,351
to confirm a successor.

213
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,295
But sir...

214
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,873
Schedule the meeting for tomorrow.

215
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:00,967
Tomorrow?

216
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,336
If there's one way to
disrupt a man's plans,

217
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:07,672
it is to destabilize his timeline.

218
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,954
If they are indeed
planning something together,

219
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:13,786
we will not wait for
them to make a mistake.

220
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,455
We will force them into one.

221
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,207
Tomorrow's Christmas Day.

222
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,409
There's no way we'll be able

223
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,627
to get the Deus Group
together so quickly.

224
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,339
I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo

225
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,935
for the last 302 days and counting.

226
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:32,364
Anything that will disrupt that
will no longer be tolerated.

227
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:37,142
I have officially run out of patience.

228
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,205
This rash behavior will
only come back to haunt you.

229
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:44,149
When Phillip Price resigns,
you will have no CEO at E Corp.

230
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,210
Wellick.

231
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,088
I'm sorry?

232
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:52,991
Call Mr. Wellick and
offer him the CEO position.

233
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,163
Tell him you are speaking for Whiterose.

234
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,967
I have no doubt that he will accept.

235
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,694
You ever play Russian Roulette?

236
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,664
They say once you pull that
trigger, it changes you

237
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,258
and you can't go back to who you were

238
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,812
before you heard that infamous click,

239
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,586
the sound of cheating death.

240
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,847
We've been lucky so far, but
I can't shake the feeling

241
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,346
that there's a barrel pointed at us

242
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,490
and we're running out of chances

243
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,870
to get that empty chamber.

244
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,335
I'm not sure what's taking
Vera so long to come at us

245
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,149
with bullets fully loaded.

246
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,043
Every time I try to
talk to Elliot about it,

247
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,712
he puts up a wall,

248
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:56,655
like he's flat-out throwing
me a forbidden error,

249
00:16:56,657 --> 00:17:00,367
denying me the chance
to even bring it up.

250
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,770
But Vera's gonna find us sooner or later,

251
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,441
and I just hope we see
him coming when he does.

252
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:14,507
Oh, shit.

253
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,192
Krista.

254
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,644
Uh, give me a second.

255
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:20,745
Sure.

256
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,517
I've tried calling you.

257
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,407
Elliot, I thought I made myself clear.

258
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,413
Yeah, I got your letter.

259
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,189
I... I just wanted to talk to you.

260
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,514
You know that can't happen.

261
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,752
I explained that in the
letter as politely as I could.

262
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,237
You don't understand.
I'm... I'm doing better.

263
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,572
I'm finally talking to Mr. Robot

264
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:41,760
just like you always said I should.

265
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,536
We cannot have contact anymore.

266
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:44,837
Do you understand that?

267
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,205
I just want you to know

268
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,600
that I'm finally making
some real progress.

269
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,561
I don't feel safe around you!

270
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,726
Leave me alone.

271
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:10,955
Or I'll be forced to take legal action.

272
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:17,128
I wasn't asking you to treat me again.

273
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,173
I just wanted to say
thank you for helping me.

274
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,932
You okay?

275
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:32,811
Yeah.

276
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,277
Olivia Cortez was Susan Jacobs's contact

277
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,292
at Cyprus National Bank.

278
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,878
She's the Deus Group's
only U.S. account manager

279
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,266
since they want to
make their presence here

280
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,883
as minimal as possible.

281
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:03,448
She's our way in.

282
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,995
I don't see any Cyprus
National Bank accounts.

283
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,518
Yeah, these banks make their
lackeys use on-prem work boxes

284
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,864
that are closed loop and near
impossible to exploit remotely.

285
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,731
We'll have to get physical
access to her laptop.

286
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,437
Kinda makes sense.

287
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,864
What?

288
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,114
That you made this your HQ.

289
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,450
It's where it all started.

290
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,786
No better place to plan how it'll end.

291
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:37,024
It's just an abandoned office
I knew had a 10-gig fiber link.

292
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,134
Please.

293
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,749
I know you have a soft
spot for this nerd factory.

294
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,424
Where are you going?

295
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,723
Olivia's iCal says

296
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,829
her ex-husband's got her kid
tonight and she's got a date.

297
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:52,204
Should give me enough time

298
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,173
to check out her place
and get on her machine.

299
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,175
Whoa.

300
00:19:55,178 --> 00:19:57,613
You think I'm your
little research monkey?

301
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,490
We agreed I'd handle the bank contact

302
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,424
and you'd deal with the SS7 license.

303
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:05,928
That was before I knew
we needed physical access.

304
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,262
Now you're gonna stay here

305
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,907
and get the cell service permissions.

306
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,150
No, thanks.

307
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:13,394
I'm gonna stick with the plan.

308
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,248
You can spend your Christmas Eve here

309
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,634
watching rats fuck.

310
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,191
I'm gonna go out and do this B&E.

311
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,294
Will you talk some sense into her?

312
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,756
Darlene...

313
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,241
this is not your
run-of-the-mill break-in.

314
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,368
This is a Deus Group contact.

315
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,621
Yeah, I get it, dude. It's dangerous.

316
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,433
Okay, you know this whole
protective older brother act's

317
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,710
gotten beyond lame.

318
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,532
I'm telling you, this is too...

319
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,879
Risky?

320
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,107
Perilous? Treacherous?

321
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,615
Hazardous to my health?

322
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,679
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

323
00:20:58,682 --> 00:20:59,958
You're not going.

324
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,066
You're hurting me.

325
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:02,067
I know.

326
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:05,538
Is this you, or...

327
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
It's me.

328
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,078
What's happening to you?

329
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
You wanted to work with me.

330
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,582
This is the way it is.

331
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:20,002
If there's a problem, don't
be here when I get back.

332
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,132
And here I thought things
were better after yesterday.

333
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,661
But as per usual,

334
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,970
it's one step forward and
four fucking leaps back.

335
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,436
Nothing's ever gonna
change with you, is it?

336
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,774
No, it's not.

337
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:50,783
I should've never opened my door

338
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,118
when you came back into town.

339
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,192
There's no word for it, you know?

340
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,393
There's "orphan," "widow," "widower."

341
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:23,148
So what do you call someone
who's lost everyone?

342
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:30,715
Mom, dad, sister, girlfriend, friends.

343
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,291
A survivor?

344
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,804
Or a walking time bomb?

345
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,819
Elliot thinks the more he
restricts everyone's access,

346
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:43,001
the less vulnerable he'll be.

347
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:45,546
But there's a trade-off
that he's forgetting.

348
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:46,660
If you block everyone,

349
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:48,641
then what's the point of being here?

350
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,884
Of doing all this?

351
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,344
Of existing?

352
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:55,347
I'm that's her personal,
but check it anyway.

353
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:35,803
There's nothing on Cyprus National Bank,

354
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:37,074
but I've learned more
than I want to know

355
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,418
about this Evan dude
she's on a date with.

356
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,620
His name is Evan, for fuck's sake.

357
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:02,474
He's into snowboarding,
social media influencing,

358
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:04,443
and Reiki.

359
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:07,446
Classic Evan.

360
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:09,898
What'd you find?

361
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,886
That.

362
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,710
We got her credentials, but
without her security fob,

363
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,071
we don't have shit.

364
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:18,090
You check the closet.
I'll take the nightstand.

365
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:19,992
She'll have it on her.
It's bank protocol.

366
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:21,910
How do you know she
doesn't get sloppy sometimes

367
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,017
and leave it behind?

368
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,497
You read the same shit on her I did.

369
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:28,000
She's a single mom who spent
three years in night school

370
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:29,418
to get this job.

371
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,541
Someone like that isn't going to risk

372
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:34,256
the best gig they've
ever had by being sloppy.

373
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,141
So we install a listener on her machine,

374
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,309
wait for her to log in.

375
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,510
It's the holidays.

376
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,429
She isn't logging in anytime soon.

377
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,782
And even if she did,

378
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:44,650
we'd only got 60 seconds
to swipe the code.

379
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:47,686
Okay. We phish her, get her to log in,

380
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,495
catch the RSA code then.

381
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,289
We're all good.

382
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,324
If she doesn't take the bait?

383
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:55,160
We don't have time to chance it.

384
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,997
Well, if you have any
ideas, I'm all fucking ears.

385
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:27,916
Looks like he stood her up.

386
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,867
Okay, she's leaving.

387
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,411
Let's go back and regroup.

388
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:40,866
I found a bottle of
oxy in her apartment.

389
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,091
So?

390
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:48,638
She's an addict who's
supposedly gone straight.

391
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,086
Custody agreement says

392
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,644
if she gets caught using
again, she loses her kid.

393
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:59,483
So what do you want to do
with that information, exactly?

394
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:03,595
You know how this works.

395
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:05,286
- Hang on, kiddo.
- What for?

396
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,349
Why don't you try a little small talk?

397
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,234
Keep her here for a while, grab the fob,

398
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,519
and then punch in the code.

399
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:13,072
No. There's no time for small talk.

400
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:14,623
Not when we already own her.

401
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:29,930
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,834
Excuse me?

403
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,853
You're gonna want to sit back down.

404
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:39,047
What are you talking about?

405
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,904
'Cause I'm gonna buy you a drink.

406
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,438
I'm sorry, do I know you?

407
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:47,471
This is a waste of time we don't have.

408
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:48,807
I'm Elliot.

409
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:49,909
Now you know me.

410
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm gonna take off, actually.
It's been a long day.

411
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,899
Okay. I'll come clean.

412
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,693
I couldn't help but
notice you were stood up.

413
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,313
Now, it's none of my business,

414
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,739
but the guy's clearly a sack of shit

415
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:05,190
to leave you alone on Christmas Eve,

416
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,141
and if you'd let me,

417
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,161
I'd like to apologize for those
of us who have done you wrong

418
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:10,930
by buying you a drink.

419
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,893
Another round?

420
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,071
Why not?

421
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,947
It's Christmas.

422
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:30,324
You're on, kiddo.

423
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,133
There you go, Juanito.

424
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,472
Tell your mama I packed
it special for her.

425
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:08,595
Merry Xmas.

426
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,230
Tell me you brought tidings
of joy about my dude Elliot.

427
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,997
Come on, bruh.

428
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:38,309
What was so important about
this motherfucker, anyway?

429
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,312
You know why we came back here, right?

430
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:45,799
Well, do you?

431
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,592
So you could be king of New York.

432
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:49,394
And in order for our
kingdom to be built,

433
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,395
I need a brilliant...

434
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,156
Architect. I know.

435
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,473
Yeah, see? You totally get it.

436
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,117
You just be selling yourself short.

437
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,980
Hey, listen here, bruh.

438
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,047
Look, I may not be no architect,

439
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,093
but let me tell you something:

440
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,443
I'm loyal... to the bone.

441
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:07,727
So let me just get my
gun, put it to his head,

442
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,305
and make him give you
what the fuck you want.

443
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,283
How many times I gotta explain it?

444
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,203
I don't want Elliot to be my prisoner.

445
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:16,997
A visionary like him
don't work like that.

446
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,642
I want him to be my partner!

447
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:24,546
Now, reflect...

448
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,396
and give me something I can use.

449
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,577
Come on, bruh.

450
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,301
This kid is aloof.

451
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,553
I may be able to catch him
around his hood sometimes,

452
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:32,846
but for the most part,

453
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:35,724
he riding solo and giving up nothing.

454
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:37,286
What do you mean, "for the most part"?

455
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,463
Well, see?

456
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,583
You gotta be more detailed.
The devil is in that shit.

457
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:46,419
Well, look. I...

458
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:48,379
I did see him arguing
with this lady, all right?

459
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,788
And she seemed pretty mad.

460
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,532
- Mad how?
- I don't know. Mad.

461
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,242
Details, bro.

462
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:56,995
Be specific. Was she crying?

463
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,913
Was... was her nipples hard?

464
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:01,800
Did a vein pop out of her forehead?

465
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:03,269
Man, make the connection.

466
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,842
Tell me you at least
took some fucking pics.

467
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:12,477
Really, man? Of... of course.

468
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:15,239
I got you. Look. Right there.

469
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,768
You see? She's pissed.

470
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,186
So what?

471
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:23,247
Look bro, we're wasting
our time with this.

472
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:26,232
I mean, we took the
risk to get back here.

473
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:29,545
I mean, shit, we might as
well put it to good use, fam.

474
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,464
Hey, kid.

475
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:45,928
Tell me what you see.

476
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:52,050
He feels bad because she's yelling,

477
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:54,135
like when my mama's mean to me.

478
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:55,446
It makes me sad,

479
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:56,780
like him.

480
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,607
How come this fuckin' little
kid sees it and you don't?

481
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,338
This ain't about her.

482
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,615
Her anger legit.

483
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:18,665
No doubt, the shit you
need to see is on him.

484
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:21,579
She hurt him.

485
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:26,385
Not no superficial pain,
neither, we talking...

486
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:28,169
stab-in-your-heart kind.

487
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,609
She our girl.

488
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,029
She knows something I gotta know.

489
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:41,233
Sorry, bruh.

490
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:44,414
I guess I just need someone
a little more detail-oriented.

491
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:01,995
So, uh,

492
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:06,591
we already know why I'm
here on Christmas Eve.

493
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,185
What's your sob story?

494
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,764
I don't know. I...

495
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:15,693
I guess I don't have
anywhere else to be.

496
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,824
No family?

497
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:22,474
My sister and I got into a big fight.

498
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,827
My mom died yesterday.

499
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:27,705
Oh, my God.

500
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:30,708
I'm so sorry.

501
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,294
For what?

502
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,657
For your...

503
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,219
you know, that thing
about your mom dying?

504
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,557
Oh.

505
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,517
No. We weren't that close.

506
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:59,511
Yeah, I kind of have the
same deal with my dad.

507
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:02,180
I mean, we used to be pretty tight.

508
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:05,391
But not as close as my mom and me.

509
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,660
She was amazing.

510
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,856
She died too.

511
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:13,292
Back in Colombia.

512
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,421
I took it really hard.

513
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,697
I kind of put my dad through
a lot of shit after that,

514
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,674
and...

515
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:25,596
But we don't have to get into it.

516
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:29,892
Okay.

517
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,281
I'm addicted...

518
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,057
to m...

519
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,659
morphine.

520
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,759
Well, do you have some on you?

521
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,234
- Uh...
- I'm kidding.

522
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:59,463
Oh, my God. Your face.

523
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,964
And now I feel bad.

524
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:04,409
No. No, that's okay. I...

525
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,094
I deserved that.

526
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:11,249
So how long you been clean?

527
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,945
Almost nine months now.

528
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:17,088
Well, not if you count...

529
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,257
the heroin I did two days ago.

530
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:22,260
But I didn't really want it.

531
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:24,696
Well, did someone hold you
down and force you to do it?

532
00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:28,283
Yeah.

533
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,520
But I'm... I'm clean now.

534
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,501
Are you crazy or something?

535
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:42,172
I guess so.

536
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,513
I'm not like most people.

537
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:53,433
I'm starting to pick up on that.

538
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,342
Olivia?

539
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,842
Evan, from, uh, OkCupid.

540
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,366
I'm sorry. I have no idea who you are.

541
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,852
Isn't this you?

542
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,121
Nope.

543
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,522
This is totally you.

544
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,625
Look, it's getting late.

545
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,464
Well, it was nice to meet you, Elliot.

546
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,399
Well, you did better

562
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,981
Uh, just looking for some aspirin.

563
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:04,282
Oh, shit.

564
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:05,667
Here, let me help.

565
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:10,127
I've got all this crap.

566
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,848
It's not what you think.

567
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,739
Look, earlier when I told you

568
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,456
that I put my dad through
some shit when my mom died...

569
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:42,704
It was because of this.

570
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,964
I was really fucked up
after my mom got killed.

571
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,470
Murdered, actually.

572
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:09,940
I never say that to anyone.

573
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:20,808
It totally wrecked me...

574
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,443
and I couldn't pull myself out of it.

575
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:29,675
And then, one day, someone
gave me a pill, and...

576
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:34,131
That was that. It was...

577
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,241
like, my way out of that black hole.

578
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:45,308
But it led me right into another one.

579
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:54,258
One that hurt a lot less.

580
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,156
For... for a while, anyway.

581
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:13,778
A reminder.

582
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:19,116
If I hate myself enough
to start using again,

583
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,952
I might as well kill myself.

584
00:41:34,384 --> 00:41:38,195
So there it is.

585
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:41,389
The moment I tell you I'm crazy too.

586
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:49,372
I get it.

587
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,449
I know what it's like.

588
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,120
What?

589
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,741
Hating yourself.

590
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:21,238
I almost did it once.

591
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,652
What stopped you?

592
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:35,943
I promised a kid I'd take
him to go see "The Martian."

593
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,333
Yeah, of course.

594
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:48,456
You know, you can't scare me.

595
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,295
Well, there's a lot more
crazy where that came from.

596
00:42:59,686 --> 00:43:02,612
But I think that's enough for tonight.

597
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,563
Who knew Olivia would be the one

598
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:23,875
to override Elliot's
attempts to deny access?

599
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:30,071
Now he's gotten the message:

600
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,507
letting people in doesn't have to hurt.

601
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:50,224
Why are you stopped when
we've got to get to Allsafe?

602
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,487
That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

603
00:43:55,108 --> 00:43:57,034
Dark Army?

604
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:58,251
It's gotta be.

605
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:02,279
You think Olivia ratted us out?

606
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,341
No. We got out of there clean.

607
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,331
This is a trap.

608
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:07,962
We've been off the radar for months.

609
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:10,704
All of a sudden, Whiterose
takes interest in us again?

610
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:13,058
What if she's trying to
find out about our plan?

611
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:17,827
Then let's show her we don't have one.

612
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,324
Just go home and act normal.

613
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:38,041
Here's our turn again.

614
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:44,321
Loading a bullet into a chamber...

615
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:46,883
spinning the cylinder...

616
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,219
and then...

617
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:55,725
the trigger.

618
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:59,253
Question is, are we getting
that friendly click?

619
00:44:59,255 --> 00:45:03,215
Or is it the end of the game?

620
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,717
That's it.

621
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,978
We cannot go in there.

622
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,429
Let's make a run for it.

623
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:09,739
Run where?

624
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:12,057
They're outside too.

625
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:17,321
What do we do?

626
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,859
Exactly what we'd do if
we had nothing to hide.

627
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,426
Like I said before,

628
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:32,870
letting people in doesn't have to hurt...

629
00:45:32,872 --> 00:45:34,955
but it can.

630
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:37,875
Especially if they're the type
of person that doesn't ask,

631
00:45:37,877 --> 00:45:40,437
that just forces their way in

632
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,709
whether you want them to or not.

633
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:47,039
Elliot.

634
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:49,966
I've come with the news
we've been waiting for.

635
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:53,057
They want to make me CEO of E Corp.

636
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,204
Are you hearing me?

637
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:56,245
The offer came directly from Whiterose.

638
00:45:56,248 --> 00:45:58,629
What's this... what are you doing?

639
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,316
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

640
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,203
We're on the inside. It's
time to take them down!

641
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:10,988
