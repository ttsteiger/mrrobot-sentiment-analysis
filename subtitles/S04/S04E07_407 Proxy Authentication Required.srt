1
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,420
When I was a kid
and my dad pushed me

2
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:14,298
- out the window...
- Told you I was sorry.

3
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:15,956
You're just sick and
don't wanna admit it.

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,833
- You weren't pushed.
- Shh.

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,293
You jumped.

6
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,170
We got the access we needed

7
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,256
to transfer the money

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,547
from the bank's side.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,884
We can rob them blind.

10
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,619
I don't want Elliot to be my prisoner.

11
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,933
I want him to be my partner.

12
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:32,631
I gotta break him so I can build him up.

13
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:33,974
I see you now.

14
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:36,143
That is how you own a nigga.

15
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,811
I'm gonna break Elliot,

16
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,314
and you're gonna be my aluminum bat.

17
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:41,894
Mr. Robot.

18
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:44,436
That is how you break him.

19
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,865
Elliot, I was kidnapped.

20
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:47,416
He wanted to know everything about you.

21
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,743
The universe got big plans

22
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,157
- for us, bruh.
- I'm sorry.

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,239
I'm scared.

24
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:53,165
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,635
Boy's not picking up.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,417
Okay, okay, okay.

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,028
I got you, man.

29
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:34,073
I didn't know that.
All right, I got you.

30
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,577
All right.

31
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:42,542
Yeah, you got me confused.

32
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,812
All right. I got you, bro.

33
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:21,648
_

34
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,928
I've been waiting for this moment

35
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,697
for a while now.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,704
Sorry, just...

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,859
Didn't expect it to hit me like this.

38
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,695
I'm all emotional and shit.

39
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,474
Told myself I'd keep it cool, you know.

40
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,954
Told myself I wouldn't do
no fanboy shit like this,

41
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:56,938
but I'm sorry, dude.

42
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,702
I just have so much
respect for your ass,

43
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,388
it makes me all...

44
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,208
Yo, what's that word
those weird-ass Hasids use

45
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,710
for this shit?

46
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:08,128
Mm, "verklempt"?

47
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,605
That's it, verklempt.

48
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,776
You... well...

49
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,904
You like a hero to me.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,370
A hero I did wrong, not
gonna lipstick that pig.

51
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:24,082
But it was a turning point
in my story nonetheless.

52
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,168
And something tells me
it was a turning point

53
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,022
in your story too.

54
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,928
Javi, make our guest
here more comfortable.

55
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:55,175
We're on the second floor
of a three-story walk-up,

56
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,288
two armed dopes and a crazy meth head

57
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,904
who thinks he's Deepak Chopra.

58
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,314
Only exit's the front door,

59
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,392
but I seem to remember

60
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:02,793
there's a fire escape in the back.

61
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:03,944
Not thinking about

62
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:05,411
an escape plan right now.

63
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,745
Escape is the only fucking thing

64
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,230
we should be thinking about.

65
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,915
Not until we find Krista.

66
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,418
Kiddo, need I remind you

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,587
about Dominican Psycho over here?

68
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,864
Krista was just bait.
Now she's probably dead.

69
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,033
Well, we need to find out.

70
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:23,929
I just need to get him doing
what he loves to do best: talk.

71
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,456
- He'll tell us what we want...
- Yo!

72
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,142
You gonna say something?

73
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:33,481
It's been a minute.

74
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,650
How the fuck you been?

75
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:42,823
Truth is, I'm... I'm a little confused.

76
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,142
You came looking for me two months ago.

77
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,787
Why'd you wait until
today to make a move?

78
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,486
Well, if you must know,

79
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:55,544
I had to prepare, set
the stage for our meet.

80
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:00,115
This shit is bigger than
Frost-Nixon, you know?

81
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:03,302
Had to be ready.

82
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,516
Ready for what?

83
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,062
For you, bruh.

84
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:16,089
You a formidable adversary.

85
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,318
You ain't no corner bitch
I can stick my dick in.

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,695
Need to buy you dinner first.

87
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,766
That what this is, dinner?

88
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:29,978
Shit, nigga, he trying
to make a metaphor.

89
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,069
Yo, V, I thought you said
this kid a genius, bro.

90
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,608
I swear to God, if you
don't shut the fuck up...

91
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,984
How about we just cut the bullshit

92
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,045
and you tell me why I'm here?

93
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:56,171
After our unfortunate...

94
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,048
parting of ways,

95
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,216
I had to return back home to the DR.

96
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,361
Hadn't been back there
since I was little...

97
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,031
When people didn't think much of me.

98
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,310
It actually reminded me
of a dream I used to have,

99
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,628
that I would one day own that island,

100
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:15,857
that the very land everyone walked on,

101
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,919
slept on, fucked on would be mine.

102
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,196
Settle in, this looks like
it's gonna be a long one.

103
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:29,079
Except there I was,

104
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,831
back in the DR with
those same motherfuckers

105
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,541
who didn't believe in me...

106
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,002
said I wouldn't amount to nothing.

107
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,380
This time, they was wrong.

108
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,756
I had tools now.

109
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,424
I had vision I didn't have before.

110
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:42,842
So I started hustling.

111
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,888
I set up shop...

112
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,390
couple of corners here and there.

113
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,225
At first, on my own.

114
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:53,186
Then a few other niggas
got impressed, joined in.

115
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,896
Couple of block battles

116
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,773
but nothing we couldn't handle.

117
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,859
Matter of fact, it was easier than ever.

118
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,332
And like a virus, we multiplied.

119
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,263
Within 43 days, I took down every gang.

120
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,085
From there, it was easy
to get to the politicians,

121
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:21,131
especially with Five/Nine
pounding their wallets.

122
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,464
Once that domino fell, we took control

123
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:27,762
of all the favelas in both
the Dominican and Haiti.

124
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,143
I was running everything and everyone

125
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,454
from the president to the campesino.

126
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,955
And by day 87,

127
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,333
I finally had my own island.

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,705
Then on the 88th day,

129
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,173
I got bored.

130
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,908
I had everything I ever wanted,

131
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,211
but all I felt was emptiness.

132
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,789
One day, Javi over here

133
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,407
brings this crazy old shaman

134
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,647
who says he can help me.

135
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,586
So I said, "All right, let him in."

136
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,965
He sat my ass down,
prepared me a cocktail

137
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,592
of this powder... pink powder,

138
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:08,595
red blood mixed in with titty milk.

139
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:11,514
He looked into my eyes and said,

140
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,492
"You're asleep.

141
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,810
It's time you wake up."

142
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,607
Then held the cup to my lips.

143
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,880
You wanna know what I did, Elliot?

144
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,948
I gulped that shit down.

145
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,344
And then...

146
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,513
I just gotta be real with you, bruh...

147
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,956
I shit myself.

148
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,458
Then I puked myself.

149
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,387
Back and forth, back and
forth, shitting, puking,

150
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,356
till all the shit and
puke poured out of me.

151
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:49,528
The shaman then takes my
face in his hands, says...

152
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,305
"It's time for you to go home."

153
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:58,520
I didn't know what to think.

154
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,873
I told him...

155
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,786
I was home.

156
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,582
And then it hit me
why I was feeling empty

157
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,214
that whole time.

158
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,880
Home isn't where you from.

159
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,994
It's... where you supposed to be.

160
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,376
I was born Dominican, but here...

161
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,564
New York...

162
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,572
This is my home.

163
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,741
This is where I thrived.

164
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,852
And there I laid, weeping like a bitch,

165
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,436
telling the shaman I
could never go back.

166
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,915
I failed there. That
path was closed to me.

167
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,775
Shaman shook his head no.

168
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:52,424
Told me I had to reopen that path,

169
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,034
that I had to reconcile

170
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,870
with the man who closed it.

171
00:09:56,872 --> 00:10:01,475
For he was meant to be my partner.

172
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,437
Then and only then can I go home again.

173
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:14,488
That's why we sitting
here right now, Elliot.

174
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,158
That's why I came back.

175
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,436
I owned the wrong island.

176
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,232
I'm gonna take over New York,

177
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,337
and you gonna be my side when I do.

178
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,012
So what you think?

179
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,520
Where's Krista?

180
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,271
You want me to partner
with you for anything,

181
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:09,192
first things first, I need
to know where Krista is.

182
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,112
You forget we played this game already?

183
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,424
That's why I'm asking.

184
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:25,792
Now that I think about
it, this was Isaac's knife.

185
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,805
You remember him, don't you?

186
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,391
My brother.

187
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,360
This is probably the same one
he did your girl Shayla with.

188
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:44,995
No one here wants to see no rerun, bruh.

189
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,418
You're not gonna kill Krista.

190
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:54,588
She's the only thing you got over me.

191
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,366
Can't believe, with
all that enlightenment,

192
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:01,577
you'd come back here
to be just as stupid

193
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,388
as you were last time.

194
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,099
Stupid?

195
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:09,335
Last time we did this dance,

196
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,605
I got everything I wanted, didn't I?

197
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,050
You didn't get me.

198
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,954
Where is she?

199
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,666
She good, bruh.

200
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,694
Show me.

201
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,479
Poor Elliot...

202
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,050
Always caught up
worrying about the pussy.

203
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,656
Is that all you want?

204
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,118
Simple meet and greet?

205
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,163
Okay.

206
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,316
But then after that,

207
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:16,819
I'm gonna want my own
special introduction.

208
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:30,070
_

209
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,482
- Elliot.
- Are you okay?

210
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,688
No, no, no, no, we ain't
having no sidebar here.

211
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:40,299
Alls I said was you could see her.

212
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,631
You need to let her go.

213
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,955
You already on to your second demand

214
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,967
and you ain't even honored the first.

215
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,906
I said I need an introduction.

216
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,046
What introduction?

217
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,014
Mr. Robot.

218
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,934
I don't know what you're talking about.

219
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,102
Nah, come on, dude.

220
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:23,633
Let's move past the bullshit.

221
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,363
I got your therapist here, remember?

222
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,607
I know everything about you.

223
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:32,779
So tell me, how do we get him out?

224
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,837
How does this voodoo shit work, exactly?

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,028
Do we say "Mr. Robot"
three times in the mirror?

226
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,278
Rub a lamp?

227
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,290
Roll your eyes back, play Bob Marley,

228
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,033
light some candles?

229
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,552
What do you want from him?

230
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,888
Alls I wanna do is talk to him.

231
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,299
How 'bout you let her
go and then we'll talk?

232
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,829
Remember what I said,
anything happens to her...

233
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,826
Don't touch her!

234
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,528
Don't worry, I'm not touching.

235
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:08,315
I'm just taking her temperature.

236
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,674
But Javi over here,

237
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,485
he just got out of a bad relationship.

238
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,187
He need a rebound.

239
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,171
He been looking at Miss Krista all day

240
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,857
with them hungry eyes.

241
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,400
He gotta eat sometime.

242
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,553
You can't blame him, can you?

243
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,696
We all gotta eat, Elliot.

244
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,165
You wanna talk?

245
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,636
Let's talk.

246
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,647
How do I know it's you? I
didn't see no puff of smoke.

247
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:43,925
Let's get one thing straight, fuck-face.

248
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,944
I ain't no puff of smoke.

249
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,071
Welcome to the party, Mr. Robot.

250
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,207
I'm not here to party.

251
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,075
You wanna talk, get to it already.

252
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:11,469
- What do you want?
- Yo.

253
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,854
I don't care who the fuck you are.

254
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,223
You need to calm it down, homey.

255
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,891
I'm not talking to you.

256
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,715
Where that courage now, bitch?

257
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,196
Right fucking here.

258
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:33,833
Let's keep this friendly.

259
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:34,818
Yo, V, I ain't trying...

260
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:35,902
Peanuts, God damn it,

261
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,746
I said put the gun down!

262
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,008
What kind of name is Mr. Robot anyway?

263
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,344
Some Nickelodeon bullshit, man.

264
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,848
What kind of operation
you running here, exactly?

265
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:05,765
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, man.

266
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,033
It's just a trip.

267
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,468
It's like I'm really
talking to another person.

268
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,140
That's because you are.

269
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,973
So stop wasting my
time, and start talking.

270
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,441
I thought we was talking.

271
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,351
What am I doing here?

272
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,445
I don't know.

273
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,781
That's a good question.

274
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:33,593
Why... are... you...

275
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,772
here?

276
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,502
When assholes like you come around,

277
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,340
I make sure he has someone on his side.

278
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,310
Oh, what that make
you, then, the muscle?

279
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,978
His protection?

280
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,989
Something like that.

281
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:02,080
How you think that's going?

282
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,197
Don't matter, though.

283
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,842
I ain't here to judge
your job performance.

284
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:19,431
I didn't ask what you do. I
asked you why you were here.

285
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,176
How did you start?

286
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,643
- He needed me.
- Why?

287
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:33,548
If you here to protect him,

288
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,924
that means he got hurt real bad.

289
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,675
I just wanna know
what scared him so much

290
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:40,934
that he needed your bitch
ass to come to the rescue.

291
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:44,772
This is cute and all, but
I gotta be real with you.

292
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:49,127
You're too stupid to do this.

293
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,880
What is it that you
think I'm doing, exactly?

294
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:52,297
Trying to get inside my head.

295
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,614
Oh, I already in there.

296
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:54,782
You're so sure of yourself.

297
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,209
- I am.
- Why's that?

298
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,211
'Cause there's a method

299
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,645
to Elliot's madness,

300
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,714
and I think you know what it is.

301
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,975
You wanna know what it is?

302
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,643
I'll tell you what it is.

303
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,616
He's smart. He's angry.

304
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,795
Put those two things together,

305
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,267
you stay the fuck out of the way.

306
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,696
Yeah, blah, blah, blah,
that's your spin zone

307
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,059
"Fox & Friends."

308
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,594
How 'bout you give me the real headline?

309
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,784
You read her file. Put
two and two together.

310
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,288
His father died when
he was eight years old.

311
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,074
His mother treated him like
her own personal ashtray.

312
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,317
He needed someone to help
him cope with the world.

313
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,577
Voilà, you got me.

314
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,079
No doubt, shit's heavy,

315
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,657
but it ain't actionable.

316
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,245
I need details.

317
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:38,584
How 'bout we skip the psychobabble

318
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,054
and get to why we're really here?

319
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,424
You said you wanna own this island

320
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:46,351
and you need my help.

321
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:51,264
So this job interview
isn't about my credentials.

322
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,941
It's about yours.

323
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,634
And like I said, with your operation,

324
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,362
I don't know if you
could run a White Castle,

325
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,604
much less New York.

326
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,302
You want me to work for you.

327
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,534
It's clear you don't
wanna force me into it,

328
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,537
which means you gotta
start convincing me.

329
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,583
Convincing you?

330
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,545
Let's not play dumb.

331
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,715
If she told you about me,

332
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,593
I gotta think she told
you about Five/Nine.

333
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,163
So you know the things I've done,

334
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:26,891
things I've been able to pull off.

335
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,303
I'm not someone you
push around with a gun.

336
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,729
I am the gun.

337
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,733
So yeah, you gotta convince me.

338
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,478
Because right now,

339
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,405
if this is your master vision,

340
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,056
do yourself a favor.

341
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,983
Go back to that little shaman of yours

342
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,060
and shit some more,
because you're clearly

343
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:47,454
still full of it.

344
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,826
I wanna own every corner of this city.

345
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,432
I want them all pushing my product.

346
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,764
And I mean everyone,
not just no drug dealers.

347
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,083
Every business, every storefront,

348
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:12,211
every billboard in this city,
every train in every tunnel,

349
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:13,672
every pig in blue.

350
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,176
From the night whores
walking the streets

351
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,184
to the day whores on
the Upper East Side,

352
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:21,643
from the rapists down in lockup
to the ones in the high-rises.

353
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:25,814
I wanna roll five boroughs
into one Dominican blunt,

354
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,467
smoke that shit as I count my cash

355
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,803
and ash on these Warbuckses'
white, bald heads.

356
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:34,065
That is my master vision,

357
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:38,077
and that... Mr. Robot,

358
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,313
is what I want.

359
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,666
I wanna own this island.

360
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,715
So let me see if I got this.

361
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,719
You wanna get into real estate.

362
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:54,995
Is that it?

363
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,331
Is that what all this is about?

364
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,926
Is that really your
groundbreaking epiphany here?

365
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,128
No.

366
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,232
That can't really be it, is it?

367
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:08,508
In your word salad,

368
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,511
I heard something about drug dealing.

369
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,888
Thing is, Pfizer and Eli are
a few billion ahead of you,

370
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,182
and they can buy your death
with the same half-cent

371
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:17,276
it costs them to make a pill.

372
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:18,644
You wanna get into billboards?

373
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:19,871
Download Photoshop.

374
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,206
Make yourself a cute portfolio.

375
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,025
Stores, with the debt everyone's in,

376
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,619
I'm sure they'll gladly give 'em to you,

377
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,822
in which case, you'll just
be owned by their banks.

378
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:31,290
Trains are even more bankrupt,

379
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,600
and don't even get me
started on the NYPD.

380
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,994
Even that blunt you wanna
roll is gonna be marked up

381
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,532
by Big Tobacco itself.

382
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:41,208
Point is, this city's one
big, fat credit card bill,

383
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,335
and you wanna pay it,
all so you can, what,

384
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:45,521
be another suit with a mortgage?

385
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,567
Unless you're after a
monopoly on stupidity,

386
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,010
please tell me you have more.

387
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:54,179
Please tell me you didn't waste my time

388
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:56,200
when you could have just
enrolled in some night classes

389
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:57,891
at the Brooklyn School of Real Estate

390
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,577
and left me the fuck out of it.

391
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,989
This ain't about being
no landlord, bruh.

392
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,991
This is about power.

393
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:09,495
Power is just an asshole
stuffed with money.

394
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:11,497
And while you're most
definitely all stocked up

395
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,988
on asshole, money, you just don't got.

396
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,668
I gots plenty start-up capital.

397
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,261
Whatever you have isn't
enough, not for this.

398
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,263
Ain't no thing. I can
stick up a few joints.

399
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,159
How much we talking?

400
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:21,298
Even asking that means

401
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,417
you're thinking too small.

402
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,545
Behind every great fortune,
there lies a great crime.

403
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:29,607
That is the corporate motto
of these United States.

404
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,852
You wanna oink-oink with all
the other capitalist pigs?

405
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,946
It's not about how much money.

406
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,949
It's about robbing money itself.

407
00:23:43,698 --> 00:23:45,772
And you can do that for me?

408
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,377
I think I have a plan
that could help you.

409
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,846
But step one of anything we do together

410
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,483
is always gonna be let her go.

411
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,496
But didn't you say she was
the only thing I got over you?

412
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:10,189
Javi, Peanuts, am I deaf,
or did he not say that?

413
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,424
Yeah, I heard it.

414
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:14,468
Yeah, I heard it, most definitely.

415
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,564
Hey, you need to recollect
correct, Nickelodeon.

416
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:22,657
So if I let my only insurance policy go,

417
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,080
then how am I gonna trust

418
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,978
that this money gonna come to me

419
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:29,700
or that this plan of yours
even exists in the first place?

420
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:33,779
You know, come to think of
it, she didn't even trust you.

421
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:35,581
It was in her notes.

422
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,417
Ain't that true, Miss Krista?

423
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:41,012
What was it again? How'd phrase it?

424
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,997
"Patient is extremely guarded,

425
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,894
which presents a barrier
to honest processing."

426
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:51,931
That don't sound too good, Mr. Robot.

427
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:57,361
If she can't trust you, why should I?

428
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,606
I'll show you.

429
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,857
Show me what?

430
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,573
My plan,

431
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,211
the hack.

432
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,130
It's going down tonight.

433
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:18,716
You let me do it, I'll steal more money

434
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,459
than you know what to do with.

435
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:23,930
That'll be a better partner
to you than anyone else.

436
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,543
Why you willing to part
with all this dough?

437
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,303
I don't give a shit about money.

438
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,648
I just wanna take it from them.

439
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:40,260
How exactly you gonna do that?

440
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:44,533
I'll show you.

441
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,524
I got it all on my laptop:

442
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:56,587
bank statements, account balances,

443
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,381
the whole exploit.

444
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,181
Javi, go get his bag.

445
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,123
You know, you don't need Mr. Robot.

446
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,297
He barks a lot,

447
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,632
but he ain't the bite

448
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:44,209
behind all that havoc
you wreaked, is he?

449
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:53,019
See, that right there,
that's why you my dude.

450
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,054
I'm more scared of you than him.

451
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:02,394
You got something to show me,

452
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:04,262
then let the show begin.

453
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:18,332
_

454
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:12,464
Look at all them zeros.

455
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:14,166
I can't even count 'em all.

456
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,504
Oh, yeah, that's stadium money, nigga.

457
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:21,339
The fuck is stadium money?

458
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:25,260
Yo.

459
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,265
Yo, Javi, come take a look.

460
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:37,957
Oh, shit.

461
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:41,441
Yo, you right, that is stadium money.

462
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,586
Bro, oh.

463
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,183
You don't got it in you.

464
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,537
I got your bullets, bitch.

465
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:33,995
You really think I didn't
have Javi check your bag

466
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,806
the second we grabbed you?

467
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,240
Oh.

468
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:43,378
Maybe I was wrong about you, bruh.

469
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:46,558
Old Elliot never would
have picked up that gun,

470
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,802
let alone pulled the trigger.

471
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,178
I like to think I had something to do

472
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,264
with that little mean streak in you.

473
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:54,658
You make me proud,

474
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,036
but I can see we still
have some work to do.

475
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,522
It wasn't him. It was
me. It was my fuckup.

476
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:02,026
You don't need to take it out on him.

477
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,407
Take it out on you, him,

478
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,501
the fuck does it matter?

479
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,286
Same brain gets the bullet, don't it?

480
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:07,713
I had a lapse, doesn't mean you give up

481
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:08,619
on all those zeros.

482
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,046
That's still very fucking real.

483
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,048
Nah, man.

484
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,283
None of this is real,

485
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:13,677
not until we have trust.

486
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,287
We can figure this out. You just gotta

487
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,771
put the gun down.

488
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,423
Stop being so thirsty, bruh.

489
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,852
I ain't trying to talk to ya anyway.

490
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,963
Where you going?

491
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,514
Let's go, sweet thing.

492
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:31,744
Let's go.

493
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,012
Wait, stop.

494
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:38,048
You wanna throw away all
that money for nothing?

495
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:39,611
I'm not the one who
just tried to shoot me

496
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,047
for no goddamn reason.

497
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,448
No goddamn reason? You would
have done the same thing.

498
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,899
Incorrecto, cuz.

499
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,867
I would have made sure to kill your ass,

500
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,627
like I'm about to do to her.

501
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,123
Hey, you hurt her, you
might as well kill me next.

502
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,340
You lose everything.

503
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:55,305
That does appear to
be the pickle we're in.

504
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:57,887
So what to do? What to do?

505
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,914
We go back to the plan
before I fucked everything up.

506
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,968
Yesterday's news, bruh.
Been there, done that.

507
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,385
Wait! Wait, wait!

508
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:07,563
After I steal the money,
I'll be your partner, okay?

509
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,808
I will be your partner. I
will do whatever you want.

510
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,718
Warmer, but not quite
there since I know for sure

511
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,586
I can't trust you.

512
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:14,014
Wait, wait, wait! There's gotta be

513
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:15,262
something we can figure out!

514
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:16,648
Tell me why I shouldn't shoot her.

515
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,059
Because she's a good person.

516
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:19,683
No, tell me why I shouldn't shoot her.

517
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:21,186
She doesn't deserve this!

518
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:22,483
Details, motherfucker!

519
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:24,234
Tell me why I shouldn't shoot her!

520
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:25,954
Because I need her!

521
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,334
She helps me.

522
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:43,976
Oh... I get it now.

523
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,354
She your shaman.

524
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,984
The fuck does that mean?

525
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,721
It means now we're getting much warmer.

526
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,408
See, I've been going
about this the wrong way.

527
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,704
I thought you would give me
the answer I was looking for.

528
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,700
But maybe I was the wrong person

529
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:10,753
asking the question.

530
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,910
_

531
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:29,521
Have a seat, bruh.

532
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,091
What is this?

533
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,819
We gonna have a little therapy session.

534
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,322
It's finally time you saw that you and I

535
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,532
are destined to be partners.

536
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,143
You ready?

537
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:47,072
Didn't I tell you to sit your ass down?

538
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,669
We gonna find out what's going on

539
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,713
inside that little head of yours.

540
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:57,716
Ain't that right, honey bear?

541
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,869
What do you expect me to do, exactly?

542
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:03,847
I expect you to pick up
where you last left off.

543
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,793
Why you looking at me like that?

544
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,336
Don't you do this for a living?

545
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,856
- Yes, but...
- I don't wanna hear no buts.

546
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,018
Alls I wanna hear is
this therapy session

547
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,360
getting kicked off.

548
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:22,107
You sick, sadistic piece of shit.

549
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,808
What's the point of this?

550
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,036
You're just gonna kill us anyway.

551
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,372
It's fine, Krista. Let's
just do what he wants.

552
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,441
Elliot, he's just trying to
find another way to hurt you.

553
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,650
He just wants a show.

554
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:34,044
Let's give him a show.

555
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,125
That's right.

556
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,368
I'll be sitting right here,

557
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,887
eating my popcorn.

558
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,583
What you're asking for is impossible.

559
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:51,061
You won't get anything out of this.

560
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:55,590
This only works in a controlled setting,

561
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,568
alone,

562
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,320
just me and him.

563
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:07,560
Peanuts, Javi, take a walk.

564
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,912
What?

565
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,021
Nah, nigga.

566
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:13,191
Now I wanna know what happens.

567
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,859
Yeah, dawg, I'm kinda curious

568
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:15,919
where you going with all of this.

569
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,363
I said take a fucking walk!

570
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,041
Nasty cabbage ass,

571
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,311
had to go on and ruin everything.

572
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:44,281
That's as alone as you gonna get.

573
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,283
That's not what I
meant, and you know it.

574
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,359
You're pointing a gun at me.

575
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,935
You're forcing me to
talk to one of my pati...

576
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:50,362
Ah!

577
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:52,164
Okay, okay, calm down.

578
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,069
Krista, look at me.

579
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,319
Ask me some questions. It's easy.

580
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,656
You know how to do this,
same as we always do.

581
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,136
Come on, Krista.

582
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,496
It's fine. Pretend he's not even here.

583
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:10,915
Listen to your boy.

584
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:13,293
Come on, you can do it.

585
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:14,919
Look at me.

586
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,897
Let's talk about my mom.

587
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,650
She just passed away.

588
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:21,318
Why don't we talk about that?

589
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:26,148
Are you okay?

590
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,068
I'm fine.

591
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:33,956
You know we didn't talk a lot,
so it didn't hit me that hard.

592
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,009
I think it got to Darlene, though.

593
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:42,914
Come on, keep going.

594
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,884
There's gotta be something
more you wanna ask me.

595
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,722
Now that you've had some
time to think about it...

596
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,768
How are you feeling about her death?

597
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,106
I haven't thought about it that much.

598
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,192
Is that a bad thing?

599
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:06,863
Well, there was a lot of pain there.

600
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,366
- She hurt you...
- Yeah, yeah!

601
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,894
I know all this. That's all old shit.

602
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:16,981
There's no gold there.
I need that 24-karat.

603
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:19,359
I don't know how to do what you want.

604
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:20,877
You said Elliot's got a secret

605
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,320
and the only way I can unlock it

606
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:24,715
is to find out why Mr. Robot exists.

607
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:31,388
What's he talking about?

608
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:34,671
She sold us out is
what he's talking about.

609
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:36,465
I'm sorry. I had to tell him something.

610
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:37,985
I didn't know what else to say.

611
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:42,215
What did you tell him?

612
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:44,067
Look, we are running out of time here.

613
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,908
We gotta start thinking
about an exit strategy

614
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,764
and fast, while his pals are gone.

615
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,272
Do you know what she's talking about?

616
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,723
What does it matter?
Did you hear what I said?

617
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,016
- We gotta get out of here.
- Here.

618
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:54,631
- Let me help you start.
- Those are my private charts.

619
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,276
"Elliot's preoccupation with Mr. Robot

620
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,772
suggests an emotional component

621
00:36:57,774 --> 00:36:58,856
- to the relationship"...
- Don't do this.

622
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,525
Oh, you upset. I'm sorry.

623
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:03,069
Maybe I should stop.
How 'bout it, Elliot?

624
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:05,590
You sure you don't wanna
know what she wrote in here?

625
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:06,582
He's fucking with you.

626
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,804
He's trying to play
his little mind games.

627
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,971
She doesn't want me to hear this.

628
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:17,917
Why?

629
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,919
Who gives a shit?

630
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,105
We gotta focus on a way out of here.

631
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:26,318
You don't want me to hear this either.

632
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:32,223
Keep reading.

633
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,618
No, don't do this. Elliot,
it's not a good idea.

634
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,145
I said keep reading.

635
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,230
Ooh, I like this one.

636
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:41,774
"Strained relationship with Mr. Robot...

637
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:46,154
keeps us from exploring
the root of his condition."

638
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,048
What does that mean?

639
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,908
Answer the man's question.

640
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,618
Tell me what that means.

641
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,996
Elliot, this is not how
this is supposed to work.

642
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:56,640
She's right. This... this has to stop.

643
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,665
"Childhood trauma,

644
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,581
follow up on window event."

645
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:06,566
What's so important
about this window anyway?

646
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:12,764
You won't talk.

647
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,474
No problem. Let me look it up.

648
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:16,017
- Let's see, window...
- Stop it.

649
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,352
Just stop it! These are just my notes.

650
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:20,480
You're not supposed to hear
any of this in this way.

651
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,500
I don't give a shit what
I'm supposed to hear.

652
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,835
What are you hiding?

653
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:29,214
Is this about Mr. Robot?

654
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,367
No, not Mr. Robot.

655
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,405
Darlene?

656
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:36,847
No.

657
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,289
Who, then?

658
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,482
Don't say anything.

659
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,042
What does this have
to do with the window?

660
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,062
No one was there except my father.

661
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,772
Is this about my father?

662
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,304
- What about him?
- Please don't make me do this.

663
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:55,198
- What about him?
- Don't make me do this.

664
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,059
- Krista, don't.
- Shut up.

665
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:01,229
Krista, there's no use holding back.

666
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:03,081
Tell me what's going on.

667
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,894
The day he pushed you out the window...

668
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:09,974
My dad didn't push me. I... I jumped.

669
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:11,957
Darlene told me. I remembered it wrong.

670
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,718
- See, she doesn't even know...
- I said shut up!

671
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,374
- Keep going.
- Let's get it, bruh.

672
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:27,335
Why is it you think
you... you can't recall

673
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,589
that memory so clearly?

674
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,553
Pay attention.

675
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,555
Miss Krista's asking you questions.

676
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:38,224
I don't know why. Do you?

677
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,803
- Answer me.
- I... I... I don't know.

678
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,249
But I...

679
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,860
I can ask you details about that day

680
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:50,587
to help you remember.

681
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,464
Like what?

682
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,032
What were you doing
that day in your room?

683
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:59,718
Uh... Darlene and I
were building a snowman.

684
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:02,364
We went upstairs to look for my camera.

685
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,076
And did you find the camera?

686
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:08,188
Darlene told me we didn't.

687
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:11,084
What else did Darlene say?

688
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:15,611
She said... that we heard my dad coming

689
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,323
and I told her to hide in the closet.

690
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,355
Then what happened?

691
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:27,648
Uh, he walked in the door
and I grabbed my baseball bat.

692
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,109
And then?

693
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:33,296
I started swinging it and yelling,

694
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,615
smashing everything in the room,

695
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:37,634
and then I jumped out the window.

696
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:40,411
Do you actually remember these events,

697
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,639
or did Darlene tell you this?

698
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,141
Darlene.

699
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:49,921
Is that similar to other
instances in your life

700
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:51,982
when you've lost time?

701
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,737
No, only when Mr. Robot takes over.

702
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:01,265
Do you think it's possible

703
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,602
Mr. Robot is the reason
why you can't remember?

704
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,333
What's she talking about?

705
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,486
You didn't exist when I was a kid.

706
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:14,820
Did you?

707
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,008
That's not important.

708
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,135
What's important is that I'm here now.

709
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:22,512
Stop lying to me. How
long have you been here?

710
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,497
Don't you see what's happening?

711
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:27,350
She pushed us apart before.
She's doing it again.

712
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,127
Answer the question! How long?

713
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,463
How long have you been
messing with my head?

714
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,357
What do you want me to say?

715
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,026
I've been here since the first day

716
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,134
that I was needed.

717
00:41:37,136 --> 00:41:40,680
I exist for a reason. I always have.

718
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:43,307
It's always been my job to protect him.

719
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:46,143
You know this isn't the
way. This is dangerous.

720
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:50,243
You can't do this to him.
Please do not do this to him.

721
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:52,042
He's not supposed to know.

722
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,364
Know what?

723
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,386
Elliot, do you believe
Mr. Robot when he says

724
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,221
he's here to protect you?

725
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,102
Yes.

726
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,755
So if it's possible
that it could have been

727
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:18,068
Mr. Robot that day, do
you know why he might have

728
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,012
picked up that bat and
jumped out that window?

729
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:24,015
Why are we going through
all these details again?

730
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:25,241
Get to the fucking point!

731
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,227
That's it, bruh. Find that poison.

732
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,231
Do you think Mr. Robot
was protecting you

733
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,084
from something in that moment?

734
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,365
Like what?

735
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:46,596
You said you did this when
your father came into the room.

736
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:54,045
Elliot, look at me.

737
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:01,611
Why do you think you had
such a strong reaction

738
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,722
when your father came into the room?

739
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,169
I don't know.

740
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:21,793
I don't know.

741
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:25,242
I... I can't...

742
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:29,246
I can't remember.

743
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,251
Elliot.

744
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:41,801
Maybe...

745
00:43:44,472 --> 00:43:46,180
I was scared.

746
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:50,577
What were you scared of?

747
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,773
Krista... you do this,

748
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,525
it will destroy him.

749
00:43:57,527 --> 00:43:59,485
Elliot, what were you scared of?

750
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,392
He already told you that he can't...

751
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,030
Remember.

752
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,826
His father.

753
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:20,047
That's it, right? You
were scared of your father.

754
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:24,343
No.

755
00:44:24,345 --> 00:44:27,197
Why would I be scared of him?

756
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,032
He was my friend.

757
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,044
I can't protect you anymore.

758
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,892
Why would I be scared of my father?

759
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,064
Do you recall a time...

760
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:06,236
Your father ever hurt you?

761
00:45:06,238 --> 00:45:08,404
Hurt me?

762
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,099
He would never hurt me.

763
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:16,329
I told you, he was... he was my friend.

764
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,773
He was my only friend.

765
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:25,755
Then what made you scared that day?

766
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:29,509
I wasn't.

767
00:45:30,453 --> 00:45:32,453
You told me you were scared.

768
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,550
I, uh...

769
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:39,102
Is that what I said?

770
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:46,217
Um... I'm... I'm confused.

771
00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:53,950
You and your sister were in the room.

772
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,064
You heard your father's footsteps.

773
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,776
No.

774
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:09,299
You think it's possible you
hid Darlene in the closet

775
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,991
to keep her safe?

776
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:14,137
No.

777
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:18,808
Your dad walked into the room...

778
00:46:21,754 --> 00:46:23,761
No.

779
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,356
No.

780
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,134
You grabbed a bat to defend yourself.

781
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:31,178
No, no, no, no.

782
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,269
You yelled at him to get away.

783
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:40,051
You swung the bat at him.

784
00:46:40,054 --> 00:46:41,146
No.

785
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:46,336
And you escaped the
only way you knew how.

786
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:57,180
Why were you afraid of your father?

787
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:09,025
Were you afraid he was going
to ask you to do something...

788
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,677
you didn't want to do?

789
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,904
Yes.

790
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:37,628
Do you remember what he asked you to do?

791
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,404
Yes, I remember.

792
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,058
Elliot.

793
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:04,247
Did your father sexually molest you?

794
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:15,925
Yes.

795
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:09,156
_

796
00:49:14,814 --> 00:49:17,820
Elliot, I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

797
00:49:23,403 --> 00:49:26,329
Elliot, hear me, bruh.

798
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:29,838
I know it feels like you're all
alone right now, but you're not.

799
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,459
I know this pain, your pain.

800
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:37,309
It's okay to feel
whatever you're feeling,

801
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:39,491
and if you can hear me,

802
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:42,929
I want you to know you don't
gotta be scared no more.

803
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:46,891
Don't... don't touch me.

804
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:49,852
Don't touch me.

805
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:05,184
- My brother...
- Stop.

806
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,785
Please stop.

807
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:09,664
You know there's nothing
you can do to stop this.

808
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,126
I don't know how to live with this.

809
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:15,898
I don't wanna live with this.

810
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:17,788
- Not an option you got.
- Yes!

811
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:20,365
Yes, there is. There is.

812
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:24,243
There has to be,
because I can't do this.

813
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:25,240
I can't.

814
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:26,556
I know it hurts right now,

815
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:28,132
but you purging all that poison.

816
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:30,468
Soon you can be your true self.

817
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,937
My true self?

818
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:36,430
I don't know who that is.

819
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:39,009
I don't know who that is!

820
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:41,053
That's because you're still holding in

821
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:43,948
all the anger and sadness.

822
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,826
What do I do?

823
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,990
Right there, that's what you do.

824
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:54,750
You let it out.

825
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:58,570
Amen.

826
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,449
Once you let it all go,

827
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,610
then you can finally meet the real you.

828
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,842
This ain't a death.

829
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:14,270
Elliot, you've been reborn.

830
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:19,025
Why?

831
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,095
Why?

832
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:25,140
Why... why... why... why would he do...

833
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:26,449
There is no why.

834
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:30,995
You weren't the one in control.

835
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:34,744
I know it's hard to go on

836
00:51:34,747 --> 00:51:38,610
when you're carrying
this around, but you can.

837
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,048
How?

838
00:51:43,117 --> 00:51:45,176
You don't carry it alone.

839
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,263
I'm here with you, bruh.

840
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:55,294
You.

841
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:59,840
You did this.

842
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:02,059
You did this to me.

843
00:52:03,345 --> 00:52:05,896
- I did it for you.
- No.

844
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,576
No, I don't believe you!

845
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:10,901
I did this because I could
see this wound on your face.

846
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,311
From the first time I met you,

847
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:14,313
I just wanted to show you the light.

848
00:52:14,315 --> 00:52:17,149
- This is bullshit!
- Ain't no bullshit, bruh.

849
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:18,984
The only thing that happened just now

850
00:52:18,986 --> 00:52:20,485
is that you finally faced the truth.

851
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:23,047
You've been looking away
from your whole life.

852
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,265
And now that you know the truth...

853
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,667
You can use it.

854
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,197
I know 'cause I done it.

855
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,992
I been through it.

856
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:55,696
My ma...

857
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:58,023
she used to pass me
around to her friends

858
00:52:58,025 --> 00:52:59,549
when she'd go out to get high,

859
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,360
and let's just say her friends...

860
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:05,530
They took a lot from me.

861
00:53:09,203 --> 00:53:12,871
Your dad, he took a lot from you too,

862
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:15,132
but he didn't take everything.

863
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,543
See, this shit you went through,

864
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,372
most people don't know pain like that.

865
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,047
They never will.

866
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:25,384
And if they did, it would end them.

867
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:30,013
But the people who dig in,

868
00:53:30,015 --> 00:53:31,804
the ones who keep surviving,

869
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:33,658
those are the ones you can't beat.

870
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:36,346
Those are the ones no one can beat.

871
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:40,393
Because once you've weathered
a storm like yours...

872
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,111
You become the storm.

873
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:51,076
You hear me?

874
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,747
You are the storm.

875
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:06,091
And it's the rest of the world
that needs to run for cover.

876
00:54:13,142 --> 00:54:16,160
Your power is beautiful.

877
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:20,647
Elliot...

878
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:22,458
it's special.

879
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:31,008
Don't you believe that?

880
00:54:32,118 --> 00:54:34,135
I don't know.

881
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:38,516
Do you wanna believe it?

882
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:44,146
I just...

883
00:54:48,343 --> 00:54:50,528
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

884
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,139
Hey.

885
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:00,979
You're not alone.

886
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,568
I see you now.
