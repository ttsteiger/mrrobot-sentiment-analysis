1
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:05,533
_

2
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:08,554
Is this really it...

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,071
The moment this can all truly end,

4
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,220
reverse everything we've done,

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,473
finally bring Five/Nine to an end?

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,109
This is what democracy looks like!

7
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,561
I fought so hard to protect
the New York facility

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,647
that I couldn't see the bigger picture.

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,451
A reported 71 buildings
exploded or caught fire.

10
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:31,121
You have been appointed CTO at E Corp.

11
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:33,790
The CTO title is nothing more than that.

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,700
The position is worthless. You heard him.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,719
We can use it.

14
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,726
I suppose there's some
banal excuse why a month

15
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,299
isn't enough time to get my
project shipped to the Congo!

16
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,469
Now I want you to
imagine your mom, Trudie.

17
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:48,380
Am I illustrating my point?

18
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,006
You work for the Dark Army now.

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,175
It was you who exported the keys.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,478
You could make it like
Five/Nine never happened.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,481
Whatever happens after this,
I want us to keep talking.

22
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:58,755
I want us to be a team.

23
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,623
My associates found your pet employee.

24
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:02,974
I am your father.

25
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,434
Angela Moss was allowed

26
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,228
to continue with her lawsuit,

27
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,525
which put my plant in jeopardy.

28
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,012
You're panicking right now.

29
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:13,087
The minute you remove emotion from this,

30
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,363
you'll do just fine.

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,114
You need to talk to Angela.

32
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,424
She is not doing well.

33
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,410
Last time I saw her,

34
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,504
she was going through
a full-on breakdown.

35
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,215
The cyber bombing, that was my fault.

36
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:25,434
She used me for that.

37
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:29,104
I have to believe that
there was a purpose.

38
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:31,941
Pettiness.

39
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:36,278
It was a dig at me.

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,806
It's that small, unfortunately.

41
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,562
No, it's not over.

42
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,957
It's not over. It can't be.

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,961
She was gonna bring my mom back.

44
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:55,947
We were gonna be reunited.

45
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,561
What are you gonna do to her?

46
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:19,571
What are you asking?

47
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,659
Retribution...

48
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:24,827
I want it.

49
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,664
I'm afraid your only move here:

50
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:33,293
accept that you've been conned.

51
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,173
Find a way to live with what you did.

52
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:43,178
No.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,423
You're wrong about her project.

54
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:49,184
I know it's possible. I've seen it.

55
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,773
And I know how to take it from her.

56
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,011
Don't you get it?

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,697
With everything that we know,

58
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,074
this is what we have to do.

59
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,610
- Shut up.
- We can expose her.

60
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,040
We can tell everyone what she showed me.

61
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,395
Shut up!

62
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,480
Sh-shut up.

63
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,670
No, I won't.

64
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,141
And if you're not gonna help me,

65
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:16,045
I'm gonna do it on my own.

66
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,697
And there is nothing you
can do or say to stop me.

67
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,809
I wish you hadn't said that.

68
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,829
You have to understand.

69
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,526
I have been trying to
stop her from hurting you.

70
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,830
That's... that's why I brought you here.

71
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:03,550
But you ta... you talk like
this, and I cannot protect you.

72
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,306
You have to relent.

73
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:13,209
There's a chance, if...
if you... if you beg.

74
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,680
It's the only way out of
this, please, please, please.

75
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,756
Shh.

76
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,776
You're panicking right now.

77
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:25,641
Remove all emotion,
and you'll do just fine.

78
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,536
Isn't that what you're good at?

79
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,843
I'm not gonna run.

80
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,437
So you should probably leave.

81
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,261
She made her choice.

82
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:53,837
Choice?

83
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,006
That's not allowed when it comes to you.

84
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,207
No, no, you...

85
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,352
you did this to her.

86
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,256
You... you... you
recruited her and you k...

87
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,591
you killed...

88
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,568
And you let it happen, didn't you?

89
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:17,060
It wasn't without a valiant
attempt on your part, though,

90
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,328
trying to talk some sense into her.

91
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,165
It isn't your fault that
she wouldn't listen.

92
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:23,625
You didn't give me enough time. She...

93
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,402
She could have... she
could... she could...

94
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,964
she could have come around.

95
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,241
I meant everything I said to her.

96
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,452
You are psychotic.

97
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,848
You're certainly not mincing
words today, are you?

98
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,480
It's all psychotic.

99
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:48,984
Phillip, if you feel you
must take this out on me,

100
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:50,986
then I am happy to bear the burden.

101
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:53,311
I've become very good
at it over the years,

102
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,873
don't you think?

103
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,817
She was my daughter.

104
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,086
I'm sorry for your loss.

105
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,086
Our team has an update
on the shipment hack

106
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:18,704
we obtained from Mr. Alderson.

107
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,182
It appears it will grant us

108
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:22,425
the clearance we need
by the end of the year.

109
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,675
It's October now,

110
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,854
so that's two more
months we'll have to wait.

111
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,734
Just in time for the holidays.

112
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,660
What is it?

113
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,281
Mr. Alderson is a good-for-nothing wretch

114
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:46,950
that is not to be trusted.

115
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,378
Oh, Wang Shu, you needn't worry.

116
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,008
Once our project ships,
he'll have served his purpose

117
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,624
and then he can be terminated.

118
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:58,307
In the meantime, he needs
to be kept on a short leash

119
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,632
and trained not to bite his master.

120
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,726
Very well, then.

121
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,505
Send him a reminder of what's at stake,

122
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,651
should there be any interference.

123
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,689
I hope you enjoy your last Christmas,

124
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,158
my dear Elliot.

126
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,623
And then she says to me,

127
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:13,004
"I don't think that's the North Pole."

128
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,383
Freddy, got a package for you.

129
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,385
And I got a package for you.

130
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,556
That's not funny.

131
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,878
Can we at least get
the Secret Santa going?

132
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:27,518
It's already 8:00.

133
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,064
Fred?

134
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:37,453
Come on, we gotta start wrapping it up.

135
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:40,549
My babysitter keeps texting me.

136
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,626
Just a sec.

137
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,168
Oh, that's great.

138
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,420
Can you say it again?

139
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,047
What?

140
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,652
Can you tell me you like me?

141
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,221
I like you.

142
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,492
Tell me you love me.

143
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,654
Uh, I love you.

144
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:14,690
Okay.

145
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:20,905
Maybe, uh, stand up, turn
around, and say it again.

146
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,698
You want me to stand up?

147
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,334
Yeah.

148
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,123
How ya doin', Freddy?

149
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:45,095
Not too good? That's okay. I get it.

150
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,538
Jerking off to underage girls

151
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,457
on live video chats is one thing.

152
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,394
When it's played back,
though, kinda loses its magic.

153
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,229
- Who is this?
- Check your email.

154
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,210
You should have received
a message from me.

155
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,277
Need you to open the email
and click on the link.

156
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,038
You the one that sent me the package?

157
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,781
Listen, please don't do this.

158
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,891
Look, I-I can pay.

159
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,952
Open the email and click
on the link, Freddy.

160
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,081
Okay, look, if... if this

161
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,083
is some sort of a ransomware thing

162
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,253
or you're trying to get
money out of me, listen...

163
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,316
You obviously don't know
me, because if you did,

164
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,598
you'd already know I don't
give a shit about money.

165
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,850
Do what I'm telling you,

166
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,495
or I'm sending the video to the FBI.

167
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,845
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

168
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:26,988
No.

169
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,265
Fred, I gotta go.

170
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,975
I'm just wrapping up in here.

171
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,519
Then you have to ask Trish
to do the Secret Santa,

172
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,163
because I need to get home.

173
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:37,740
Okay, okay, fine. Okay, good, yeah.

174
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:39,650
Freddy, I need you to pay attention.

175
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,652
What are you doing in there?

176
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,612
Are you on the phone?

177
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,841
Merry Christmas, and
I'll... I'll see you in 2016!

178
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:49,452
Open the email and click on the link.

179
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,329
You know, this isn't
gonna get past our IT guys.

180
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,331
That's what I'm counting on.

181
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,688
Okay, I just clicked it.

182
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,963
Are we done?

183
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,066
Get the USB from the envelope.

184
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,028
I left instructions on
how to archive your inbox.

185
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,556
Copy the .pst file to the thumb drive.

186
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,867
Inbox?

187
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,560
I'm an attorney, pal.

188
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,189
That inbox is full of
sensitive client information.

189
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,024
You hear me?

190
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,029
Hello?

191
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,336
I was just taking a moment

192
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,075
to think about whether
or not I give a fuck.

193
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,827
I don't.

194
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,392
♪ Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

195
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,483
- ♪ Jingle all the way ♪
- All right, so...

196
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,838
what are you gonna do with
my emails once you do get 'em?

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,990
Once you're finished,

198
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,734
leave all your personal
effects in your office:

199
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,843
your phone, your Fitbit, your smartwatch,

200
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,553
anything with an on-off switch,

201
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,722
then bring the USB
drive to Grand Central.

202
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,516
You know, this isn't
just gonna destroy me.

203
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,227
It's gonna destroy the
people that work for me,

204
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,396
my firm, their families, everyone.

205
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,621
Keep this phone on you.

206
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:03,192
Expect another call when you get there.

207
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,612
Who the fuck is this?

208
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,074
This is Mr. Robot.

209
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,451
I'll load it up for ya.

210
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,103
Taxi!

211
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,408
42nd and Lex, Grand Central.

212
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,951
Increase by 20%

213
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,995
- this holiday season.
- Can you believe that?

214
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,477
Not long ago, we were talking
about an economic collapse

215
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,291
on par with the Great Depression.

216
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,825
Especially hard to believe

217
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,324
given the November jobs report
that was released on Friday.

218
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,981
Over 400,000 jobs were added.

219
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,008
This really shows the
resilience of E Corp

220
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,135
and their CEO, Tyrell Wellick.

221
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,137
If it weren't for their data recovery

222
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,972
and their Ecoin loan program,

223
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,948
we wouldn't be enjoying the turnaround

224
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,660
we're experiencing right now.

225
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,436
A quote from the chair
of the Federal Reserve

226
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,479
seems to echo public opinion:

227
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,441
"Sometimes the good guys
really do come out on top."

228
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,487
All right.

229
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,177
Hey.

230
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,864
Walk to the furthest kiosk.

231
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,201
Get in line.

232
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,311
Okay.

233
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,063
I'm, uh... I'm here.

234
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,881
I'm in line.

235
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,929
Don't get freaked out.

236
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,180
You're being tailed.

237
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,190
What? Why?

238
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,934
They want to know who you're meeting.

239
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,397
I'll take care of them.

240
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,737
- Right now...
- Okay.

241
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,066
I need you to stop looking around

242
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,634
like you're a coked-up Henry Hill.

243
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,298
Well, I-I-I actually did some.

244
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,075
- What?
- Yeah, some blow, you know.

245
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,536
Uh, some of the girls
had some at the party,

246
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,076
and I... you know, the Christmas party.

247
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:03,598
- A little or a lot?
- What?

248
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,250
How much did you do, a little or a lot?

249
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,398
Shit, man, I don't know.

250
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,545
Right now, it seems
like a fucking lot, okay?

251
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,380
Take a breath, Freddy.

252
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,923
We're gonna get through this.

253
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,555
Wait a second. Where are you, anyway?

254
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,116
As far as you're
concerned, I'm everywhere.

255
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,809
What does that even mean?

256
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,104
It means I own the entire station.

257
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,345
Buy a ticket home.

258
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,803
No, don't want these
guys to know where I live.

259
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,597
Trust me, Freddy, they already know.

260
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,333
All right, uh, I'd like a...

261
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,186
first train to Brewster, please.

262
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,572
Okay, I got it.

263
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,424
All right, now you're
gonna head to the train,

264
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,879
but we're gonna take the long way.

265
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,635
Want you to walk past the clock

266
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,262
and go towards the Hudson News.

267
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,770
Take out all your cash.

268
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,646
Give it to the guy in the Santa hat.

269
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,076
Why?

270
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,156
We gotta buy time.

271
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,824
Fold it into a ball,

272
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,391
make a fist, toss it in the case.

273
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,592
Don't stop. Keep going.

274
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:32,103
Make a right and head to the tracks.

275
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:34,207
Hey, hey, hey.

276
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,429
Hey, hey, that's my money.

277
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,347
Track 19, last car on the right.

278
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,225
So you have been
following me, haven't you?

279
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,227
No, I've been waiting...

280
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,853
For you on the train.

281
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,046
Who the fuck are you?

282
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,524
Thought I answered that already.

283
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,820
Don't think you need the phone anymore.

284
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,724
Sit down and give me the drive.

285
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,941
Yeah, first you're gonna give me

286
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,360
all the copies of that video you have.

287
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,409
You gonna shoot me in
front of all these people?

288
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,117
Put the gun away, Freddy, and sit down.

289
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,193
I'm serious.

290
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:56,962
I'm not afraid to use this if I have to.

291
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,965
And then that video will not
only be automatically sent

292
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,318
to the FBI but to your wife and kids.

293
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,988
Is that something you're afraid of?

294
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,809
Sit down. Give me the drive.

295
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,741
So we're square, right?

296
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,677
You gonna erase that video?

297
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,746
I mean, it goes without saying.

298
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,415
I can't have anyone seeing that.

299
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,667
Look, I'll tell you what:

300
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,139
you keep that drive.

301
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:39,504
That'll show you how
much I trust you, huh?

302
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,647
You understand me, man?

303
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,692
I'm trusting that your word is good?

304
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,854
I'm gonna head on back to the office.

305
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,010
Sit down.

306
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,597
We're not done.

307
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:56,104
Do you know who those guys were,

308
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,166
the ones who were following me?

309
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,960
Dark Army.

310
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,664
Jesus Christ.

311
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,415
What the fuck were those
guys doing following me?

312
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,353
They want to know who
you're giving these files to.

313
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,368
Why?

314
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,587
Because they're protecting
one of your clients.

315
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,330
What client?

316
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,681
Whiterose.

317
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,375
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

318
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,403
Who's that?

319
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,460
You know her as Zhi Zhang,

320
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,879
the Chinese minister of state security.

321
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,303
He and his partners have been using

322
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,800
shell corporations to move money around,

323
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,178
and your name keeps popping up
on all their company filings.

324
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,680
Oh, shit.

325
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,282
That's what this is about?

326
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,892
I'm a dead man.

327
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,371
I need to know how you've
been helping them funnel money.

328
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:40,124
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't
want to fuck with these guys.

329
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,236
If half the shit that I've seen is real,

330
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,030
then these guys are the
official fucking bogeymen.

331
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,325
And I'm not talking conspiracy
bullshit either, man.

332
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,995
I mean, these guys are pure evil.

333
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,348
I'm kind of ahead of you on that point.

334
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,378
Cyprus National Bank.

335
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,942
That's it.

336
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,593
That's their bank.

337
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,848
Tell me what you know about it.

338
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:17,686
I don't know shit, man, okay?

339
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,063
The reason they even hire peons like me

340
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,604
is 'cause I'm willing
to look the other way

341
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,659
and push the right papers for 'em,

342
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:26,462
small stuff, incorporation documents.

343
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:27,905
Look at me. I'm a dumb shit.

344
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,794
You think they're
gonna tell me anything?

345
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,548
I may have... a contact in the city.

346
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,887
Who?

347
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,558
Stop fucking around, man.

348
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,810
We don't have a lot of time.

349
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,162
Give me the name.

350
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,316
John Garcin.

351
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,509
Where can I find him?

352
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,569
Well, I don't have the address on me.

353
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,373
I-I gotta go back to my office.

354
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,751
I told you to leave
all your electronics.

355
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,169
I did.

356
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,004
I don't... I don't have anything on me.

357
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,356
Look, I have nothing.

358
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,145
Go straight to the 42nd Street exit

359
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,441
and wait for my call.

360
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:44,773
Don't stop. Don't turn around.

361
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, you're leaving me?

362
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,087
If they see us together,
we're both dead.

363
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,007
Go.

364
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,637
Meet me at the corner
of 42nd and Vanderbilt.

365
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:49,713
Okay.

366
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,817
Then what?

367
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,401
Still need Garcin's address.

368
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,630
Oh, no, you gotta be fucking crazy.

369
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,707
I'm not going back to my office.

370
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,144
Those guys are gonna be
looking for me there.

371
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,331
Let me worry about that.

372
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:03,185
Listen, I want your word that
if I give you what you want,

373
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,728
you're gonna destroy that video.

374
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,914
You are in no position
to negotiate right now.

375
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,023
Just fucking move.

376
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,410
Then I want your word!

377
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:11,359
If we don't get out of here,
I'm not gonna be the one

378
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,162
you need to worry about, you understand?

379
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:14,696
I am your only way out of this.

380
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,907
And just how the fuck
are you gonna protect me

381
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,460
against the Dark Army, huh?

382
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,076
Those guys just saw me
running away from them.

383
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,078
They know that I'm up to something.

384
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,924
Oh, you can't...

385
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,340
protect me,

386
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:37,778
can you?

387
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,201
Freddy?

388
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:48,104
Jesus Christ.

389
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,796
You don't give a shit
what happens to me.

390
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,795
Freddy, we don't have time for this.

391
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,780
You need to snap out of it.

392
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,824
They are still coming for you, man.

393
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,544
You need to make it to this
fucking corner right now.

394
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,914
Right now, Freddy.

395
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,477
Freddy, you need to keep moving.

396
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,588
Hello?

397
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,692
Just don't send that video to my kids.

398
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,470
Freddy!

399
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,688
Freddy?

400
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,161
Excuse me. Excuse me.

401
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,781
We need room here. We need room.

402
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,860
Hey, listen...

403
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:42,193
Taking pictures right now, lady?

404
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,011
What are you gonna
do with them? Come on.

405
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,288
Put it down. Back up.

406
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,099
Jesus Christ.

407
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,165
Today's gonna be another busy one

408
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,944
because of the cyber
bombings memorial brunch.

409
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:10,215
The board of directors
would like you to do

410
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:12,835
some PR interviews today
before you head upstairs.

411
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:14,629
Our media consultant
is going to debrief you

412
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:16,616
with some talking points
back in the greenroom

413
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,379
before we put you into hair and makeup.

414
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:20,548
You have about five
minutes before your meeting

415
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,741
with Mr. Milligan and his team.

416
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,211
Thank you, Elizabeth.

417
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:25,886
Oh, that's not all.

418
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:27,784
After that, you have a
meeting with the board.

419
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:30,582
It's more of a meet and greet,
then straight into a meeting

420
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,501
with the Ecoin engineering
team to discuss the new rollout.

421
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,731
And tonight the board would like...

422
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,730
Can we just...

423
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,066
push any of this until tomorrow?

424
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:42,403
No, I'm afraid tomorrow's
already full as well.

425
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,574
Can you just give me a minute?

426
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:49,076
Certainly, sir.

427
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,442
Congratulations.

428
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,694
I've been meaning to tell
you that for a while now,

429
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,101
but I wanted to give you your space.

430
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:06,135
Most of us here consider
you a hero for what you did.

431
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,825
Mom?

432
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,569
Dom? You up yet, hon?

433
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,322
I'm heading out to go
mall walking with Janice,

434
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,551
you know, that lovely girl I
met at church a few weeks ago?

435
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,263
I want you to meet her.

436
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,265
I think you two would really hit it off.

437
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,417
Seriously, Dom?

438
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,377
It's almost noon.
You're still in your PJs.

439
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,272
What gives?

440
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,442
You all right?

441
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,593
What's he doing here?

442
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,263
I told you last week I was
renovating the master bathroom.

443
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,907
What's the big deal?

444
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,603
What's the matter with you?

445
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,609
I thought we agreed I would
vet everyone you hired.

446
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,070
Oh.

447
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,113
Hon, I thought you were
kidding like you do.

448
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,241
Listen, I'm glad you're up.

449
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,700
I want you to put a load in

450
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,140
so you have something to
wear to the bake sale later.

451
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:58,373
Janice is coming over after
for some macaroni and gravy.

452
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,642
You're just gonna leave
this guy here alone?

453
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:03,604
He's not alone. You're here.

454
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,790
This John Garcin practically posts

455
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:49,858
every shit he takes.

456
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:50,764
It's gonna take forever

457
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,394
to go through his social media.

458
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:54,838
I know we have our issues,

459
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,015
but it's these people
that are the real psychos.

460
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,535
I mean, how proud of
your life can you be?

461
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,688
We have his address.

462
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,407
We should just go.

463
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,692
We'll get the info we need there.

464
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,528
It's too early for that.
We don't know enough.

465
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,747
He's their liaison at
Cyprus National Bank.

466
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:15,417
He's gotta have something.

467
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,118
Be that as it may, we can't just knock

468
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,204
on this guy's door and pretty
please ask him for his access,

469
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,124
so we put our heads
down, do the research,

470
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,210
find a way to break him, same as always.

471
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,004
Took us two weeks with Freddy.

472
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,048
We can't wait that long anymore.

473
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,176
We're running out of time.

474
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,720
By next week, Whiterose
will ship her project.

475
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,772
We'll be dead.

476
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,807
I'm not gonna argue that with you.

477
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,060
Freddy could have saved us a lot of time

478
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,444
if his brains weren't splattered

479
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:45,813
all over 42nd Street right now.

480
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,546
He had it coming.

481
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,197
They all do.

482
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,072
Don't do this for the wrong reasons.

483
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,559
You're angry, and I get it.

484
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,853
But your anger is
keeping you from seeing

485
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,333
the bigger picture of
why we started this thing.

486
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,281
You told me once

487
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,367
you don't take down a conglomerate

488
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,869
by shooting them in the heart,

489
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,805
'cause they don't have hearts.

490
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:47,434
You were wrong.

491
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,229
We found their heart.

492
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,721
We rob it...

493
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,640
she finally goes down.

494
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,368
What am I not seeing?

495
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,581
This used to be about saving the world.

496
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:12,866
You're making it too personal.

497
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:15,778
You're making this about
what they did to Angela.

498
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,282
You're letting your
feelings cloud your judgment.

499
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,301
My feelings?

500
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,304
See what's going on out there?

501
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:28,249
People are already
forgetting about Five/Nine,

502
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,668
the cyber bombings.

503
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,466
They're buying their Ecoin
discounted stocking stuffers

504
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,486
and Christmas hams, and
they're gonna forget.

505
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,280
And I don't blame them.

506
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,701
They're exhausted.

507
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:49,329
I'm exhausted.

508
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,607
But we let this go,

509
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,525
it'll be back to business as usual

510
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,361
for Whiterose and her friends.

511
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,298
The more she gets away with
this, the worse this gets.

512
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,344
So fuck my feelings.

513
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,424
I'm done with the therapy sessions.

514
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,611
This is all I'm focused on.

515
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,171
It's Darlene.

516
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,124
She says it's about Angela.

517
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,298
Oh, my God, thanks for calling me back.

518
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,334
Um, I think I figured it out.

519
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,970
Okay, I am... I am
really onto something.

520
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:57,138
Just wait until you hear this.

521
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,899
It's kind of a breakthrough.

522
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,734
Where's Flipper?

523
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,428
Uh, the landlord took her for the week.

524
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,764
Why? What are you too busy with?

525
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,350
What's going on, Darlene?
What are you doing here?

526
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,229
I think I saw Angela.

527
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,283
We talked about this already.

528
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,427
Angela's gone.

529
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,371
Are you on something right now?

530
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,416
Don't make this about that, okay?

531
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,627
Just listen to me.

532
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,047
Okay, I need you to hear this.

533
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,049
I'm listening.

534
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,469
Okay, um, I was... I was walking by

535
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,140
one of those shelters,
and I think I saw her.

536
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,392
Okay, I-I-I-I tried to catch up with her,

537
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,978
but it was... it was
crowded and I lost her,

538
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,314
but... okay, but this is proof, right?

539
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,610
This is proof.

540
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,812
Maybe this is why they
never found her body.

541
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,110
Maybe she's still alive.

542
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,462
That's not possible.

543
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:06,541
No, I am telling you I saw her.

544
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:09,544
She was on the street, same
red cart, same bathrobe,

545
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:11,579
exactly the way we saw her
in that security footage

546
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:12,582
before she got into that van.

547
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,332
- Darlene.
- Maybe she escaped.

548
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,417
I swear I saw her.

549
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,252
Maybe if you would just help me,

550
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,129
we could find her together;
we just need to canvass

551
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,815
- all of the homeless shelters.
- This has to stop.

552
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:24,767
Elliot, we can't give up on her, okay?

553
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,807
We can't.

554
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,845
You did a little too much coke

555
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,805
and you saw something that wasn't there.

556
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,656
I will show you where I saw her.

557
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:32,676
Just come with me.

558
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:35,853
Look at you, man. You are
so fucked up right now.

559
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,772
Fuck you.

560
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,834
This is exactly what you do
when shit like this happens.

561
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:42,360
You shut down.

562
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,289
Angela's dead.

563
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,488
Do you understand?

564
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,249
She's fucking dead.

565
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,891
And it's not our fault.

566
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:01,212
We tried to help her, remember?

567
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,431
She did this to herself.

568
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,178
You have to stop feeling guilty.

569
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:15,351
I'm not the one that feels guilty.

570
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:32,493
Why didn't you just show her
the photo Whiterose sent to us?

571
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,901
You mean the one with
Angela's brains blown out.

572
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:40,251
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

573
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:44,973
At least it would have
put her out of her misery.

574
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:55,516
It'd break her heart.

575
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,025
We need to get back to work.

576
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,151
John Garcin should be our only focus.

577
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,133
I know we don't usually do this,

578
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,970
but I have to fill you in if he won't.

579
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,691
That's why you're back, isn't it, to help?

580
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:39,619
You gotta be noticing it, then, too,

581
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:42,196
that he's not talking to you.

582
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:45,107
He doesn't talk to me that much either,

583
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,918
not since Angela died.

584
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,130
Darlene's right.

585
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:51,965
He's shutting down,

586
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:54,658
compartmentalizing the pain,

587
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,454
living in the distraction,

588
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,915
just like the holidays:

589
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:06,629
the fake Santas, the plastic trees,

590
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,222
the annoying Christmas carols...

591
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:11,726
♪ O come, all ye faithful ♪

592
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:13,895
One big song-and-dance production

593
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:17,306
to sell ourselves the theater
that everything's jolly,

594
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,309
at least for a moment.

595
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,311
But when it's all over,

596
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,022
Santa's gone back to his shitty day job.

597
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,192
The trees get disassembled
and thrown in a closet.

598
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,111
The music's faded away.

599
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,987
What then?

600
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,174
That's why you can't go anywhere.

601
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:37,085
I know he's keeping you
away, but I'll let you in.

602
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:38,923
Don't think I'm doing
it for you, though.

603
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,204
Let's be clear.

604
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,256
I still don't give a shit about you,

605
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,758
but he does.

606
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,376
This does not feel right to me.

607
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,228
E Corp owns the building.

608
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,025
They own half of Manhattan.

609
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:54,468
We stick to the plan.

610
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,638
And right now, Elliot needs
you more than he lets on,

611
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,308
because when that cold, brutal
reality closes in on us,

612
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,944
we're gonna need a friend,

613
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:05,205
and that's still what you are, right?

614
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:32,900
Um, a delivery

615
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:36,594
for John Garcin in apartment 7C.

616
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,915
Seventh floor to the
right of the elevator.

617
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,917
Thank you.

618
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:02,538
This goes sideways,

619
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,839
We don't have enough
information to break this guy.

620
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,185
We're just gonna own his Wi-Fi.

621
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:09,436
That'll grab us whatever
we need without him knowing.

622
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,276
Is it just me, or is this

623
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:19,220
the quietest building
in all of Manhattan?

624
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,096
Hello!

625
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:48,057
Anybody home?

626
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,738
Let's check things out
before he comes back.

627
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,099
That wasn't the plan.

628
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,851
We're only supposed to own his Wi-Fi.

629
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,995
Are you kidding?

630
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:11,906
He's not here. We just got lucky.

631
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,941
Search everything.

632
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,728
Something's not right.

633
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,789
No shit.

634
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,365
Ah, fuck.

635
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,575
Did you lock the door?

636
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,802
No.

637
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,763
Signal's dead in here.

638
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,498
They're jamming it.

639
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:18,380
Shit.

640
00:45:37,994 --> 00:45:39,419
Phone's dead.

641
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:43,756
- It's almost as if...
- There is no John Garcin.

642
00:45:45,927 --> 00:45:47,835
Freddy set us up.

643
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:01,149
It must have been a distress
signal they gave Freddy.

644
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,098

No!

656
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,682
Let me go!

657
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,850
Stop! Let me go!

658
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:20,928
Wait! Wait!

659
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,032
♪ Don't worry, be happy, now ♪

660
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:35,534
So Father DiMarco spills his
potato salad all over her,

661
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:37,644
which I actually think he did on purpose

662
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,487
because Sister Merkin has,
you know, those big tatas

663
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,117
underneath all that black and white.

664
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,169
Ma, come on.

665
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:45,569
Oh, get over it.

666
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,170
She's a hottie.

667
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:49,381
I've seen you check
her out once or twice.

668
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,384
Janice, right, are you with me?

669
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:54,462
Sister Merkin is a ten, am I right?

670
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:59,166
Uh, s-she's quite attractive, yes.

671
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,562
See, Janice agrees.

672
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,734
Oh...

673
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:08,974
Look at the time.

674
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:10,144
I gotta get to bed.

675
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:12,012
I'm seeing Dr. Passante in the morning

676
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,931
for that thing on my neck.

677
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,743
Dom, hon?

678
00:48:16,745 --> 00:48:19,620
Why don't you help Janice
carry out the leftovers?

679
00:48:20,915 --> 00:48:23,082
It's just some macaroni.

680
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:24,584
Dominique, don't embarrass me.

681
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:25,626
Go on and help.

682
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:40,707
Oh.

683
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,576
Uh, my apologies.

684
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:44,544
I forget how frightened

685
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,014
people can be of them the first time.

686
00:48:46,016 --> 00:48:47,848
I'm a taxidermist.

687
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,275
Uh, I wasn't frightened,

688
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:51,802
just a little unexpected is all.

689
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:57,033
Taxidermy, huh?

690
00:48:57,786 --> 00:49:00,528
Guess you were into
stuffed animals as a kid?

691
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,534
Not particularly, no.

692
00:49:10,632 --> 00:49:14,708
Well, um, it was nice
meeting you, Janice.

693
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:20,640
And, uh, I'm sorry about all this.

694
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,308
All what?

695
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,174
I think my mom was
trying to, you know...

696
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:28,648
set us up.

697
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:32,056
Oh, my, I had no...

698
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:33,820
Oh!

699
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:35,655
I...

700
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:38,065
Oh, this is... this is terribly awkward.

701
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:41,661
Uh, I-I-I-I think she might
have gotten the wrong idea.

702
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:44,187
It's all good. I'm on a
self-imposed time-out anyway.

703
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,179
Okay.

704
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,000
My ma, she's just trying to cheer me up.

705
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:48,942
She thought this would help.

706
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,336
Yeah, she said you'd been through

707
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:52,004
kind of a rough patch.

708
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,298
Bet she did.

709
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,822
Um...

710
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,127
It's not a big deal.

711
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,236
It's just a promotion at work

712
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:01,622
has been a lot of stress is all.

713
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,373
Yeah, she said you
haven't been sleeping,

714
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,544
and she told me about the drinking, mm.

715
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,213
Oh, I hope I'm not
speaking out of school.

716
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,859
I-I-I just meant to say I've been there

717
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:14,743
with work, you know.

718
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,437
Long hours can really burn you out,

719
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:17,925
especially in my field.

720
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,535
But I'm here to talk, if you want.

721
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:23,759
Sometimes that can help.

722
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:26,038
Yeah. Anyway, I should get to bed.

723
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,039
Good night, Janice.

724
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,690
Yeah, that's a good idea.

725
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,864
You need your rest.

726
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:31,212
After all, you have that interview

727
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,254
about the Santiago case in the morning.

728
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,389
Excuse me?

729
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:46,392
You've put it off for weeks.

730
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:49,086
It's starting to look suspicious.

731
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,902
What did you say?

732
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:59,513
I was just explaining that
unless you go to work tomorrow

733
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,057
and finish cleaning up Santiago's mess,

734
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,409
then I'm gonna be forced

735
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:07,020
to do something very bad to your mother,

736
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,750
like, really bad, you know?

737
00:51:11,586 --> 00:51:15,087
Like, I'm probably gonna have
to slit her from mouth to cunt.

738
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,169
You touch my mom,

739
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:23,870
I will strangle you to death.

740
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,123
You understand me?

741
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,268
Oh, you can strangle me
till the cows come home.

742
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:35,438
That's not gonna stop the rest of 'em.

743
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:50,820
Now, you get that rest we talked about.

744
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:52,959
You got a big day tomorrow.

745
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:56,236
Oh, and would you thank your
mom for me for the macaroni?

746
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,587
Real life, yo.

747
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,630
I'm just saying, the
skullduggery of scientists

748
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,175
led us to this point in
believing this bullshit.

749
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,620
What bullshit, exactly?

750
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:22,846
That the Earth is a sphere
when it so clearly is flat.

751
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,350
See, you ain't even
willing to question it.

752
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,686
That's how they get
you. If the Earth's flat,

753
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,606
then how come no one's
ever fallen off the side?

754
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,334
Easy answer: Antarctica.

755
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:38,754
Whoever lives here has
to be fucking mental.

756
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,448
Dar.

757
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,155
What's up?

758
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:44,951
I just got here.

759
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,456
Please tell me you
have something stronger.

760
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,458
Hmm, stronger than what?

761
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,185
Anything I've already taken.

762
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,048
That's what's up. I got you.

763
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,551
Shit, girl, you didn't even
let me tell you what it was.

764
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,863
Why the fuck is someone
in Angela's bedroom?

765
00:53:03,865 --> 00:53:05,472
Who's Angela?

766
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:09,893
Oh, Prada, YSL, Chloé,

767
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,728
ballet shoes,

768
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,449
and a bunch of fish food
with no fucking fish.

769
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:17,400
Smells like some "American Psycho" shit's

770
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,652
going on here.

771
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:23,406
Get the fuck out of here, you
fucking Mary Poppins whore!

772
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

773
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,659
The fuck did you give me?

774
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,245
Babe, you need to chill.

775
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,247
- Fuck you.
- What?

776
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,106
Get out.

777
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,583
Get out.

778
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,395
Get the fuck out right now!

779
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:39,256
Everybody, out!

780
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,925
Out! Get the fuck out!

781
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,345
Go!

782
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,723
Get the fuck out!

783
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,393
Get the fuck out!

784
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,477
Is she listening?

785
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,963
Of course she is. She always is.

786
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,758
Was that her in the SUV outside?

787
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,652
You tell her if she
goes through with this,

788
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:08,261
my shipping hack goes public.

789
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,013
She won't be able to move shit.

790
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,351
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Hold on a second.

791
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,519
Listen to me.

792
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:18,855
The people you work
for, they're terrorists.

793
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,191
They don't care about you or any of us.

794
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,151
I know you don't want to do this.

795
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,277
You're just getting paid to.

796
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,882
Please, I can't leave like this.

797
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,203
I've hurt so many people.

798
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,391
I have to make this right.

799
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,384
Wait. Wait.

800
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,969
No.

801
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,888
You tell her if I die,
this won't be over.

802
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,700
I know all about Cyprus National Bank.

803
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,853
Her money's as good as gone.

804
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,046
Even if I die...

805
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:04,400
She's gonna pay for what she's done.

806
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,791
Do you hear me?

807
00:56:10,793 --> 00:56:15,203
You tell that piece of shit
that my anger won't die with me

808
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,540
and she can't hide from
what's coming for her!

809
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,284
You hear me?

810
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,292
You hear me?

811
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,380
Do you hear me?

812
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,430
Say something.

813
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,273
Good-bye, friend.

814
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:26,894
He got too reckless.

815
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,548
Your job was to control him.

816
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,116
My job was to protect him.

817
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,552
Your job was to protect all of us.

818
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,470
What's gonna happen?

819
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,699
