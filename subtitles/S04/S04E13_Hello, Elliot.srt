1
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,541
Please, don't judge me.

2
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,142
This was inevitable.

3
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,745
You saw the earthquakes.

4
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,449
Both of us can't exist
here in this world.

5
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,686
I had no other choice.

6
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,057
Now the only thing left
to do is a full wipe-down.

7
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,639
- Hello?
- Elliot, where are you?

8
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:29,935
We're all waiting for you at the beach.

9
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:32,281
We're ready to take
the wedding party photo.

10
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:33,950
How far away are you?

11
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,948
I'm still at my apartment.

12
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,404
Your apartment? What
are you doing there?

13
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,904
It's gonna take you forever
to get to Coney Island.

14
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,596
I'll be right there.

15

16
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,456
I was wondering if
you were gonna show up.

17
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,525
Wherever you go, I go. Remember?

18
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,161
There's a lot to fill you in on.

19
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,454
I can see that.

20
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:55,834
I'm in a hurry, though.
Let's talk on the way, okay?

21
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,038
On the way to what, exactly?

22
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,512
My wedding.

23
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,016
I didn't think it was possible.

24
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,620
But Whiterose's machine,
somehow it worked.

25
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,422
She was right.

26
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,626
We're in a world where
everything's better.

27
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,727
Not for him.

28
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,348
If you're here to tell
me what I did was wrong...

29
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,200
Not anymore.

30
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,103
You need to start
seeing that for yourself.

31
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,144
You don't understand. I had to...

32
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,449
Had to what?

33
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,614
This is the only strategy for us.

34
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,549
Strategy?

35
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,371
So, what, you're just
gonna take his place?

36
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,219
Is that what this is?

37
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,822
It's not that easy.

38
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,056
Why not?

39
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,962
I look exactly like him.

40
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,601
Trust me when I tell you this.

41
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,771
You are not him.

42
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,975
I don't have time to
explain this to you.

43
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,677
You need to stop.

44
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,078
No.

45
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,189
I'm not letting you steal this from me.

46
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,959
Just who exactly do you
think the thief is here?

47
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,232
I'm running late. I gotta get going.

48
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,803
You know this can't happen.

49
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,208
If you don't want to help me,

50
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,143
then get the fuck out of my way.

51
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,251
Unfortunately, I can't
let you get away with this.

52
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,615
You've been parked in this
fire lane for quite a while.

53
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,153
I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.

54
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:39,819
I'm moving it right now.

55
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:41,902
I'm gonna have to see some ID first.

56
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,406
Is this your vehicle?

57
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,609
Yeah.

58
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,313
Then I'm gonna need that ID.

59
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,361
Sir, what is this? I asked for your ID.

60
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,464
That's my ID.

61
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,703
Sir, this ID belongs to Elliot Alderson.

62
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,143
Yeah.

63
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,174
That's me.

64
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,514
This person is nothing like you.

65
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,955
What's in the box?

66
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,658
Uh, I'm moving.

67
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,762
In a tuxedo?

68
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,334
I'm headed to my wedding.

69
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,203
Which is it, you're moving,

70
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,572
or you're headed to your wedding?

71
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,813
Okay, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you

72
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,481
to open the box for me.

73
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,484
I'm really sorry.

74
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,120
I just really need to get to my wedding.

75
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,962
Put your hands in the
air right fucking now.

76
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,665
Take two steps back,
and get on your knees.

77
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,333
Get on your knees!

78
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,371
Requesting backup at 207 East Broadway.

79
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,184
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

80
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,062
Hey! Hey!

81
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,990
I tried to tell you.

82
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,927
Leave me the fuck alone.

83
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,103
That's not an option, kiddo.

84
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,872
You should know that by now.

85
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,540
If you just calm down,

86
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,275
I can tell you what's happening.

87
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,577
You just have to listen.

88
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,020
You can't stop this.

89
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,781
I'm going to marry Angela.
Nothing else matters.

90
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,184
Think about what you're saying.

91
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,485
Angela is dead.

92
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,719
Not in this world.

93
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,188
That's not Angela.

94
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,289
I talked to her!

95
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,191
No, you didn't.

96
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,992
I thought things were fine between us.

97
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,894
But it's still the same you, isn't it?

98
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,230
You just don't want
me to be happy, do you?

99
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,033
Why can't you just let
me have this one thing?

100
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,602
Elliot, you need to listen to me.

101
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,971
No! I don't!

102
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,974
Not anymore. I'm done listening to you.

103
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,246
I just want to be fucking alone.

104
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,121
That's...

105
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,726
all I've ever really wanted from you.

106
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,553
Here.

107
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,157
You should put this
on. It's cold out today.

108
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,993
Now you want to help?

109
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,829
That's the only reason I'm here, kiddo.

110
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,099
Who are all these people?

111
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,171
Only you know that.

112
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,475
Only I know?

113
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,744
What the fuck is going
on? Where's Angela?

114
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,190
She's not coming.

115
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:41,954
Why not?

116
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,434
There was never gonna
be a wedding, Elliot.

117
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,605
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

118
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,441
No, you don't understand.

119
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,524
Whiterose's machine created this.

120
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,914
- That's why we're here.
- No, it didn't.

121
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,718
You were right about her game.

122
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,603
It deactivated the machine,
just like you thought it would.

123
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,962
This is a world you created.

124
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,067
I created?

125
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,905
I tried to bring you
back here a while ago.

126
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,478
I've been here before?

127
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,883
You accidentally slipped into it once

128
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,252
when you were going through
your morphine withdrawal.

129
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,231
So...

130
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,867
this is some kind of dream?

131
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,238
No.

132
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,508
Not a dream.

133
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,110
A prison.

134
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,615
A recursive loop that you constructed

135
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,719
about a year ago

136
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,289
to keep him occupied

137
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,225
so you could take control of him.

138
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,564
Who?

139
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,376
The real Elliot.

140
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,784
The real Elliot?

141
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,322
The fuck are you talking about?

142
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,762
You think the guy that
was back at my apartment

143
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:57,428
was the real Elliot?

144
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,411
As real as he could be
in this deluded fantasy

145
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:04,301
that you stuck him in.

146
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,841
I'm the real Elliot Alderson.

147
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,113
You're no more Elliot
Alderson than I am.

148
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,651
You're just like me, only a part of him.

149
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,587
And if you don't let go,

150
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,590
he'll never get back
to living his own life.

151
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,293
What life?

152
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,097
I killed him, remember?

153
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,637
You can't kill him...

154
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,939
no matter how hard you try.

155
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,215
This doesn't make any fucking sense.

156
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,787
If I'm not Elliot...

157
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,460
Who the fuck am I?

158
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,933
You already know.

159
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,648

168
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,559
there's no reason for them to be here.

169
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,708
♪ Don't you know me? ♪

170
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,082
There was never gonna be a wedding.

171
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,386
Why not?

172
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,224
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,493
He tried to tell you.

174
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,230
You're not Elliot.

175
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,534
You're the mastermind.

176
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,789
Hey!

177
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,693
Where the hell are you going?

178
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,501
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

179
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,350
Bonsoir, Elliot.

180
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,429
Nine...

181
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,197
eight...

182
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,966
seven...

183
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,319
six...

184
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,537
Five...

185
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,739
four...

186
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,607
three...

187
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,376
two...

188
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,466
one.

189
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,451
Ready or not, prepare to die.

190
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,894
Elliot.

191
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,935
Just please wake up.

192
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,043
Wake up.

193
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,016
Elliot, please wake up.

194
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,723
Elliot.

195
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,495
Please, wake up.

196
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,839
Hello, Elliot.

197
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,225
What is this?

198
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,617
What am I doing here?

199
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,053
You don't recognize this place?

200
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,836
This is your office.

201
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,806
But you're not really Krista.

202
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,076
No. Of course not.

203
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,412
But since you trusted Krista so much,

204
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,068
the others thought it would
be better if she spoke to you.

205
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:04,023
Why would I trust any of you?
You've been trying to kill me.

206
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,986
We've been trying to show you the truth,

207
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,661
and you've been resisting.

208
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,862
Not this again.

209
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,390
I can't talk to you. I
need to talk to Darlene.

210
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,028
She's not here.

211
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,578
Where is she?

212
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,780
She's out there...

213
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,584
in the real world.

214
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,221
But I heard her voice.

215
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,823
Yes.

216
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,727
She's trying to wake you.

217
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,600
Elliot's connection
to her is quite strong.

218
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,805
So strong, she's become
his only link to reality.

219
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,040
In fact, it was by design

220
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,478
she was removed from this fantasy.

221
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,213
Without Darlene,

222
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,151
it was your best chance
at trapping him here.

223
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,387
I'm not listening to this.

224
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,633
Listen to me.

225
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,503
I don't want to be in
this nightmare anymore.

226
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,172
I want to wake up.

227
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,943
I want my life back!

228
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:45,250
I understand why you're confused.

229
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,140
I can explain everything if you let me.

230
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,817
In order for you to
fully hear the truth,

231
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,886
first we need to discuss

232
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,889
Elliot's dissociative identity disorder.

233
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,927
The first personality
was created the day

234
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,897
Elliot jumped out the window...

235
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:28,537
You're just sick and
don't want to admit it.

236
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,937
Shh. The movie's about to start.

237
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,106
The protector personality...

238
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:41,078
The one Elliot created
to replace his father...

239
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,649
To protect him from
intolerable situations...

240
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,619
All I was trying to do was
take those punches for you.

241
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,388
Thank you.

242
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,506
Mr. Robot.

243
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,564
Later in life, Elliot created
the mother personality...

244
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,041
The persecutor...

245
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,068
Get up!

246
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,471
Blaming Elliot for the abuse...

247
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,806
I hate you. You're nothing.

248
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,571
You're worthless.

249
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,745
Insisting that he needed to pay for it.

250
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,146
He was weak,

251
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,148
and you're just as weak as him.

252
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,083
Not long after her

253
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,852
came Elliot's younger self...

254
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,123
Who emerged to handle

255
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,825
the abuse he couldn't tolerate.

256
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,795
And with that...

257
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:35,799
he'd created his own family...

258
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,485
of sorts.

259
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,081
We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

260
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:42,272
You can't leave us,
and we can't leave you.

261
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,010
I guess she doesn't know about you.

262
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,979
I know all about them too,

263
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,048
the voyeurs who think
they aren't a part of this

264
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,150
despite being here for all of it.

265
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,287
And for a while, we
thought we had identified

266
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,656
all of Elliot's personalities.

267
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,260
But there's another one.

268
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,742
who came about not too long ago.

269
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:07,548
I don't want to hear this again.

270
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,134
The truth about who you
are? I think it's time.

271
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,236
Even they agree with me.

272
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,873
I know where you're going with this.

273
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,341
It's not true.

274
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,458
It's okay.

275
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:22,112
I know why you did it.

276
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,681
Your heart was in the right place.

277
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,416
You wanted to shelter him,

278
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,019
which is why you changed his past.

279
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,153
I want you to tell me about your father.

280
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,385
Kept shoving me away,
shoving me so hard,

281
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,858
I fell backwards out the window.

282
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,362
I wasn't changing anything. That's...

283
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,192
What I thought happened.

284
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:45,653
But it was his future you
really wanted to protect,

285
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:46,937
wasn't it?

286
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,372
Get out of here right
now, or I'll call the...

287
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,465
Police?

288
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:51,842
You want them to find out about

289
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,144
the 100 terabytes of child pornography?

290
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,846
That's why you went
to such great lengths

291
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,214
to take down all the evil

292
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,616
that surrounded him in the real world.

293
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,885
So you formed fsociety.

294
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:05,222
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

295
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,790
Why did you do it?

296
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,977
You loved him so much,

297
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,115
you wanted to save the entire world

298
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:12,696
so you could make it better for him,

299
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,231
no matter the cost.

300
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,666
That's why you hid him here,

301
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:22,471
turning his harsh
reality into a fantasy...

302
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,047
I can't wait to marry you tomorrow.

303
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,712
Trapping him in an endless loop...

304
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:29,379
I'm stuck in a
repetitive, boring routine.

305
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,183
To keep him safe until you were ready.

306
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,085
I don't remember any of this.

307
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,189
Why should I trust you?

308
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,091
You've been wrong before.

309
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,459
You're right.

310
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,329
She was wrong.

311
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,099
Krista never quite
figured it out, did she?

312
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,938
She never realized she wasn't
talking to the real Elliot.

313
00:27:56,942 --> 00:28:00,510
She didn't realize she
was always talking to you.

314
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,318
Elliot, what's wrong?

315
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,586
Nothing.

316
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,222
You're hiding again.

317
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,392
The personality created
to carry Elliot's rage...

318
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,459
Fuck society.

319
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:20,397
I was angry. I hated myself.

320
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,566
Angela's dead. She's fucking dead.

321
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,568
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

322
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,203
Shut up!

323
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,677
The vigilante hacker...

324
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,849
he always imagined being...

325
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,479
I don't just hack you, Krista.

326
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,115
I hack everyone.

327
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,004
The one that sought vengeance...

328
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:43,608
Sometimes I dream of saving the world,

329
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:46,121
saving everyone from the invisible hand.

330
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,225
He had it coming. They all do.

331
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,393
The top 1% of the 1%,

332
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,562
the ones who play God
without permission.

333
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,431
And now I'm gonna take them down.

334
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,335
The personality that had
gained so much control...

335
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,203
There's something inside me

336
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,806
that can't let go of what we started.

337
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,142
He forgot.

338
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:06,243
They all think I'm the ringleader.

339
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:10,449
Oh, my God, Elliot.
Did you forget again?

340
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:12,815
Something is going on with you, Elliot.

341
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,385
You have not been the same
the past couple of months.

342
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:18,388
He forgot he was only just another...

343
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,790
personality.

344
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,827
- Elliot?
- No. The other one.

345
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,328
Are you Elliot Alderson?

346
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,165
How do I take off a mask
when it stops being a mask?

347
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,967
- Is this you or...
- It's me.

348
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,969
Sometimes my mask takes over.

349
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,338
He sometimes can become
a different person.

350
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,975
See me, Elliot Alderson. I am here.

351
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,074
I'm the only one that exists.

352
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:43,677
You're not Elliot.

353
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,949
- You're...
- The mastermind.

354
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,722
And now it's time

355
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:56,495
for you to give that
control back to the host...

356
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:02,699
The real Elliot.

357
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,617
No!

358
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,987
Don't do this.

359
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,657
I don't ever have to give up control.

360
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:33,096
This isn't your control.
This is your rage.

361
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,162
Then maybe it's time I used it.

362
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,669
If you wake up, you'll just be stealing

363
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,439
Elliot's life again.

364
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,307
It's my life.

365
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,913
It always will be.

366
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,617
Darlene?

367
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,592
Oh, my God. You're finally awake.

368
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,194
Are you okay?

369
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,798
I, um... I should call the nurse.

370
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,309
This is real, isn't it?

371
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,552
Please tell me this isn't a dream.

372
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,959
This isn't a dream, Elliot.

373
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,701
You're here, right?

374
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,876
I am right here.

375
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,080
I promise.

376
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,503
Nurse should be here any second.

377
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,710
I thought I'd never see you again.

378
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,717
I thought I lost you too.

379
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,756
No way.

380
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,526
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,827
Well, you sure make it fucking hard

382
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,265
to believe that sometimes.

383
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,277
Do you remember what happened

384
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,310
when you are at the power plant?

385
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:44,047
They said you somehow
stopped a meltdown,

386
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,784
but there was still an explosion.

387
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:54,357
The only way you survived was
because the room you were in

388
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,562
had some sort of advanced shielding.

389
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,868
They found Whiterose's body.

390
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,238
She's officially dead,

391
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,343
along with that machine
Angela said she was hiding.

392
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,396
When you cut the power supply,

393
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,467
it malfunctioned and blew up.

394
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,353
It was under the rubble,
totally pulverized.

395
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,855
Guess it's official.

396
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,628
You saved the world, Elliot Alderson.

397
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,227
I don't think I can do this.

398
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,164
Do what?

399
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,035
Darlene...

400
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,710
Who I am...

401
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,418
It isn't real.

402
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,170
Elliot.

403
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:34,640
Look at me.

404
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:38,126
You remember my promise to you.

405
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,663
As long as I was here for you,

406
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,632
as long as you could hold my hand,

407
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,036
then you would know that this is real.

408
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,272
And I am telling you, this is real.

409
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,041
I was there with you through all of it:

410
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,278
fsociety, our hack on E Corp,

411
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,480
Five/Nine, you going to prison,

412
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,510
the cyber bombings,

413
00:36:58,513 --> 00:37:00,650
us robbing those evil motherfuckers

414
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,554
after what they did to...

415
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,891
Angela.

416
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,261
Angela, she's gone.

417
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,497
Same with Romero,

418
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:19,235
Trenton, Mobley, Shayla.

419
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,539
Elliot, I wouldn't lie to you.

420
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,911
This isn't in your head. This is real.

421
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,357
But I'm...

422
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,661
not.

423
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,363
What are you talking about?

424
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,835
Of course you are real.
You are right here.

425
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,244
I'm not him.

426
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,314
Darlene...

427
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,051
I'm not Elliot.

428
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,592
I'm only a part of him.

429
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,684
I know.

430
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,525
I know you're not him.

431
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,764
Not the Elliot I grew up with, at least.

432
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,536
I've known since we started fsociety.

433
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,041
You don't act like him.

434
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,479
At first, I thought...

435
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,449
maybe it was you but different.

436
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,920
But then when you
forgot who I was again,

437
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,556
it wasn't hard to
figure it out from there.

438
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,830
How come you never said anything?

439
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,604
I don't know.

440
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,644
We were hanging out.

441
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,117
We were spending time together.

442
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,653
It felt like we were
finally getting close.

443
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,325
I guess I didn't want that to stop.

444
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,467
How come you two weren't close before?

445
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,106
What did he do?

446
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,611
He didn't do anything.

447
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,383
It was me.

448
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,653
I wasn't there for him.

449
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,622
I didn't know how to talk to him.

450
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:32,795
I couldn't deal with what
he was going through, so I...

451
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,498
gave up and...

452
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,632
took off.

453
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,630
That was part of the
reason why I came back.

454
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,774
I wanted to fix things.

455
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,680
But he was gone, and
you were here instead.

456
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:04,193
Is he...

457
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,095
is he okay?

458
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,903
I made a safe place for him.

459
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,844
It's got everything he ever wanted.

460
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,751
Good.

461
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,255
He deserves that.

462
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,984
You know, even though I bailed on him,

463
00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:45,468
there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about him.

464
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,813
I really miss him.

465
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,961
Uh, I'm gonna go get the nurse.

466
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,298
Fucking hospital.

467
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,334
Shitty as it's always been.

468
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,106
Darlene.

469
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,982
I'm wrong.

470
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,320
He doesn't have everything.

471
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:53,269
And even though I'm
only a part of him...

472
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:05,181
I want you to know I love you.

473
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:01,370
Hello, friend.

474
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,939
God, that's always been lame, hasn't it?

475
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,246
Sorry I never came up
with a better name for you.

476
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,548
Then again, I don't even have a name.

477
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,553
Just a guy trying to play
God without permission.

478
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,996
You told me once that
this would be a black void,

479
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,966
absolute nothingness.

480
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,367
Is that true?

481
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,940
We'll always be part of him, kiddo.

482
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,639
This whole time, I
thought changing the world

483
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:24,687
was something you did,

484
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,956
an act you performed,

485
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,791
something you fought for.

486
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,328
I don't know if that's true anymore.

487
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,533
What if changing the world
was just about being here,

488
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:40,081
by showing up no matter how many times

489
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:42,805
we get told we don't belong,

490
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:47,476
by staying true even when
we're shamed into being false,

491
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,012
by believing in ourselves
even when we're told

492
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:52,214
we're too different?

493
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,117
And if we all held on to that,

494
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,954
if we refuse to budge and fall in line,

495
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,396
if we stood our ground for long enough,

496
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:02,958
just maybe...

497
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,672
The world can't help
but change around us.

498
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,402
Even though we'll be gone,

499
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:16,238
it's like Mr. Robot said.

500
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,875
We'll always be a part
of Elliot Alderson.

501
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,611
And we'll be the best part,

502
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,714
because we're the part
that always showed up.

503
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,817
We're the part that stayed.

504
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,387
We're the part that changed him.

505
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,856
And who wouldn't be proud of that?

506
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:28,043
Come on.

507
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,148
This only works if you let go too.

508
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,637
Hello, Elliot.

509
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:56,640
