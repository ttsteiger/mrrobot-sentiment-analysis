1
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:09,078
Everything we did was what they wanted.

2
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,676
I'm a prisoner, just like before.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,246
I'm going after Whiterose.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,870
I'm in. Give me your phone.

5
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:17,634
I rigged Signal's API so
we could share locations.

6
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:19,093
You fucked me!

7
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,698
I lost everything because of you.

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,664
My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!

9
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,500
The Dark Army are just hackers.

10
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:27,008
He turned the gun on himself.

11
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:28,384
He erased his history.

12
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,867
You work for the Dark Army now.

13
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,976
My whole life is ruined because of you.

14
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,009
Olivia Cortez, she's the Deus Group's

15
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:36,511
only U.S. account manager.

16
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:37,726
She's our way in.

17
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,348
You wanted to work with
me, this is the way it is.

18
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,716
If there's a problem, don't
be here when I get back.

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,179
I'm resigning as CEO of E Corp.

20
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:48,507
Call Mr. Wellick and
offer him the CEO position.

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,686
That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

22
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:56,126
Elliot, we're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.

23
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:03,668
Elliot, I've come with the
news we've been waiting for.

24
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:07,080
They want to make me CEO of E Corp.

25
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,416
Are you hearing me?

26
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:10,761
The offer came directly from Whiterose.

27
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:13,563
This is... what are you doing?

28
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,016
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

29
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,996
We're on the inside. It's
time to take them down.

30
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:26,522
I'm sorry, I've been
under a lot of stress.

31
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,423
I didn't mean to snap.

32
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,116
No, uh, I get it.

33
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,287
Okay, uh, here, have a seat.

34
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,124
You want... you want water or something?

35
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,386
Let me get you a glass.

36
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,760
There you go.

37
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:47,681
I'm gonna boot up my computer.

38
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,202
It'll just take a minute.

39
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:51,311
Fuck.

40
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:53,027
I forgot the install this morning.

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,806
Looks like it failed. I wonder why.

42
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,515
Logs say "out of disk space."

43
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,008
Just give me a second.

44
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,441
I need to adjust the swap partitions.

45
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:11,876
That should fix it.

46
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:14,931
"Boot device not found."

47
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,418
Shit, now my terminal's frozen.

48
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,859
Hard drive might be shot.

49
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:23,789
You know what, I'm gonna...

50
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,692
_

51
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,791
- Oh, fuck.
- Get in, check the logs.

52
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:58,138
If the recording wasn't
send back to Dark Army,

53
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,235
wipe everything and make
sure they can't track the van.

54
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,238
What about him?

55
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,929
He's dead.

57
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:41,336
To be clear, I am not calling you

58
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,131
because we are good.

59
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,633
I am calling because I got into

60
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,103
Olivia's Cyprus National Bank Account.

61
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,606
Unfortunately, her
access isn't good enough.

62
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,641
I can see all the Deus account numbers,

63
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,370
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything.

64
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:59,872
I got lateral access
inside the bank's system

65
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,707
but hit a wall.

66
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,359
All their authentication
goes through a proxy,

67
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,288
and everything else on
their domain is read-only,

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,867
which means we are gonna have
to break into Virtual Realty

69
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,493
and get on their servers.

70
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,221
Since the Deus Group
meeting is tomorrow,

71
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,056
I'm scouting the place now.

72
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,207
Security is lax with Christmas,

73
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,396
so we need to do it ASAP.

74
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:28,567
Also, can't help but
wonder why exactly the fuck

75
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,678
you are not answering my calls.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
We were supposed to meet at Allsafe,

77
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,849
or did you forget again?

78
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:39,227
Dick.

79
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,063
Okay, you know what?

80
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,898
I'm coming to your apartment,

81
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,040
and when I get there,

82
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,360
I expect you to have heard this message

83
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,921
and already be prepping
for Virtual Realty.

84
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:52,010
Oh, and when you do get this voicemail,

85
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,202
keep this in mind: fuck you!

86
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:58,538
You are a fucking selfish
dickhead of an asshole

87
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,601
who is the shittiest brother on Earth!

88
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,604
I don't wanna say I
hate you, but I hate you.

89
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,441
I hate you so fucking much.

90
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,609
If I show up at your
apartment and you're hanging

91
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,762
from the goddamn ceiling
by a rope, that's cool.

92
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,390
In fact, that would be my preference.

93
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,452
So in sum, fuck off and die!

94
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,165
To continue your recording, press two.

95
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,542
To delete your recording, press three.

96
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,746
Please re-record your
message at the tone.

97
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,578
Hey, Elliot,

98
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,514
it's me.

99
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,841
_

100
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:30,722
_

101
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:34,870
_

102
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,129
_

103
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:52,385
_

104
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:54,055
_

105
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,998
_

106
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,551
Elliot?

107
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,394
Okay, it looks like the
logs were never sent.

108
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,190
So all we gotta do
is get rid of the body

109
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:11,429
and the van, and we're good to go, okay?

110
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm gonna go pick us up
a couple of snow shovels.

111
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,047
We're not here for shovels.

112
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,217
What are we here for?

113
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,104
Go inside, pay for the
gas, and grab a lighter.

114
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,679
Oh, Internet's down.

115
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,097
No Ecoin.

116
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,704
$19.86.

117
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,124
Do I know you?

118
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,380
I don't think so.

119
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,418
You look awfully familiar.

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,804
Yeah, sorry, we're kind of in a hurry.

121
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,945
You sure we haven't met before?

122
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,374
Yeah, you must have me
mistaken for someone else.

123
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,710
You an actor?

124
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,880
Can you just ring him up?

125
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:20,383
Wait, were you on "Big Brother"?

126
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,802
Yeah, that must be it.

127
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,722
I knew it. I never forget a face.

128
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:27,557
Keep the change.

129
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,610
Merry Christmas!

130
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,074
Where'd you move the van to?

131
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:46,826
I didn't move the van.

132
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,655
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

133
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:18,083
Hey, hey, thief!

134
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,661
- Thief, I've called the police.
- Shit.

135
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,260
Hey, dude, you're straight
up trying to steal my car.

136
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:23,613
It's cool, man. It's cool.

137
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,349
You don't need to call the cops, okay?

138
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:27,074
- I'm walking away.
- No... hold on.

139
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,934
You trying to steal
my car and walk away.

140
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,275
What's up?

141
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,322
Dude, do you really want
to deal with the hassle

142
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:34,620
of calling the cops?

143
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,502
It's just gonna end in
an all-nighter for you

144
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,628
at the station, followed
by a shit ton of paperwork.

145
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,250
Besides, nothing... nothing happened.

146
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,110
You busted me, I'm walking away.

147
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,780
No harm, no foul.

148
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:50,428
Yeah, but I got questions
that need answering.

149
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:55,601
First, have you seen my keys?

150
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,228
No.

151
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,960
That was my only question.

152
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,737
Can I please go now?

153
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,872
Oh, wait, I got another question.

154
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,342
Can you start my car?

155
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,820
Really?

156
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:15,665
Yeah, I usually use my keys,
and I can't seem to find them.

157
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,217
Okay, you're not really planning

158
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,752
on driving like this, are you?

159
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:21,814
Well, I gotta get home.

160
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,724
Dude, you are drunk as shit.

161
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,485
Can't you just call a cab or something?

162
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:29,512
No, cabs don't go where I'm headed.

163
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,323
Where is that, the North Pole?

164
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,233
No.

165
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,120
It's Upstate. Foxrock.

166
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,693
What's your name?

167
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,118
Tobias.

168
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,529
Hi, Tobias.

169
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,591
I'm Darlene. We're friends, right?

170
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,703
Yeah, I'd like that.

171
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,371
Great.

172
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:56,697
So here's an idea.

173
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,259
I'll drive you home if I can borrow

174
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,603
your car afterwards for a quick errand.

175
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,191
You drive a hard bargain, Dolly.

176
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,368
Darlene.

177
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:09,987
Exactly. Let's ride!

178
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:16,201
Oh, guys, I understand,

179
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,037
but like I said, Internet's down.

180
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,650
Phone's hooked to the Internet,

181
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:23,450
so that means phone is down too.

182
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,452
We're kind of in the
middle of nowhere here.

183
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,126
None of our phones have service.

184
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,290
There's gotta be someplace
nearby with cell reception.

185
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,326
- Sure, back in town.
- What town?

186
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,328
Pike's Hollow.

187
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,718
How do we get there?

188
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:40,466
It's too far to walk unless
you take the shortcut.

189
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:44,254
But my husband's coming
to pick me up in a bit,

190
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,564
if you want a ride.

191
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,257
Where's the shortcut?

192
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,429
Got it!

193
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,741
Tyrell Wellick, right?

194
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:58,268
That's how I know you.

195
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,693
But I never knew you
were on "Big Brother."

196
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,286
Holy smokes!

197
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,776
I cannot believe you are in my store.

198
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,042
Can I get a selfie?

199
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:11,665
No, I'm not him. You
have me confused, okay?

200
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,313
The shortcut, how do we get there?

201
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,761
Are you sure you're not Tyrell Wellick?

202
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,170
E Corp fella.

203
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,289
You are the spitting image of him.

204
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,292
Yes, I'm sure.

205
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:25,128
That's too bad.

206
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,131
Sure like to meet him one day.

207
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,016
Seems like a nice guy.

208
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,352
Jesus fucking Christ, woman!

209
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,843
Where is the shortcut? How
the fuck do we get to town?

210
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,119
Whoa, aren't you friggin' rude?

211
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,151
Directly across the street,

212
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:49,806
you'll see an opening to a trail,

213
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,738
and that will take you through
the woods for a stretch,

214
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,491
but be sure you veer left at the creek.

215
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,410
You'll find yourself in Pike's Hollow

216
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:01,769
in 30 minutes or so.

217
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:04,750
Fucking finally.

218
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:08,537
Wouldn't hurt you to learn
some manners on the walk.

219
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,601
_

220
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:27,728
_

221
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,513
_

222
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,159

223
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:43,853

224
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:59,231
_

225
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,461
_

226
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:14,314
_

227
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:20,767
_

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,464
_

229
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,386
_

230
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,215
_

231
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:37,513
_

232
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:43,392
_

233
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,970
_

234
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:04,766
_

235
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,219
This is the right trail, right?

236
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,889
The one across from the gas station.

237
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:26,192
There was only one.

238
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,870
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,630
So quiet out here.

240
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,179
Have you ever considered leaving?

241
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,308
What do you mean?

242
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,171
Just walking off, disappearing,

243
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,314
leaving the life you're
living behind you,

244
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,865
all the bullshit, the stress, the pain,

245
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,701
everything?

246
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,037
You know, maybe start over

247
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,565
where no one knows you
and reinvent yourself

248
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,686
and forget about all the
mistakes you made in this life.

249
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,439
Find some peace.

250
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:16,442
Some rest.

251
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:19,079
I think about that.

252
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,298
Don't you?

253
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,235
No.

254
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,207
Any sign of the creek?

255
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:35,095
Well, maybe it's still up ahead.

256
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,245
Ah.

257
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,114
We've been walking for a while.

258
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,034
We shoulda come across it by now.

259
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:43,769
How do you know if we should
have come across it by now?

260
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,888
Because we've been
walking for fucking hours.

261
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,500
- That's how.
- Don't get mad at me.

262
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,336
I don't know where the goddamn creek is.

263
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,103
You were the one who took off this way.

264
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,446
Unbelievable... you're
blaming me that we're lost?

265
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,374
I blame you that we're even here.

266
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,376
- You said he was dead.
- He was.

267
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,020
Well, then how did he drive the van?

268
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,245
I don't fucking know!

269
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,006
All right, all right.

270
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:05,117
Let's all calm down.

271
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,909
Take it easy.

272
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:19,564
What was that? A dog?

273
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,569
Who knows?

274
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,036
We're in the middle of the woods.

275
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,430
Could be anything.

276
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:29,149
Maybe a coyote.

277
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,266
Or a wolf.

278
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:34,246
That.

279
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:39,643
You hear it?

280
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:42,630
Let's just keep going.
Maybe the creek is up ahead.

281
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:57,435
She knew my face.

282
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,271
What?

283
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,380
The cashier.

284
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,633
She knew my face.

285
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:06,611
So what?

286
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,630
That means she can ID me.

287
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:17,363
You search, you find, all is well.

288
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,033
But what if you search
and you don't find?

289
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,459
How long do you look?

290
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,240
Eventually, you've gotta give up, right?

291
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,122
Then what?

292
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,878
That thing you were searching
for, what becomes of it?

293
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,140
How could you ever know?

294
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,753

306
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,019
Oh, just thinking.

307
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,521
Jimmy.

308
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,840
Good guy.

309
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,843
Fell on some tough times.

310
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:32,388
You know how sometimes
the world just seems like

311
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,226
it's kicking you down
and you can't get up?

312
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,145
Christ, do I ever.

313
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:41,814
That's Jimmy.

314
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:43,691
And you know how it is.

315
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,902
Soon you're out in
the cold winter night,

316
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:50,048
asking a lot of questions,

317
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,125
looking at the world,

318
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:56,930
thinking about what it might
be like without you in it.

319
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:24,398
Do you have to do that?

320
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,459
- It's a Christmas song.
- It's annoying.

321
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:37,912
I just got it.

322
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:40,265
Why you wear that hoodie.

323
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,934
I've never seen you in anything else.

324
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:46,379
Black hoodie, black jeans, black shoes,

325
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:47,937
always the same.

326
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,960
I've been wondering this whole time,

327
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:52,631
but now I finally get it.

328
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:55,110
You don't care.

329
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,641
Sure, why not?

330
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:01,060
Silk tie,

331
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:03,330
$6,000 suit.

332
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:11,153
I mean, it sounds pathetic
to say aloud, but...

333
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,824
I actually care.

334
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,802
And you know what?

335
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,454
That's why I'm a failure.

336
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:24,166
My entire life, I've been an outsider,

337
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:27,128
worried what other people think of me,

338
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,089
how I can make them happy,

339
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:33,526
because I needed their
approval and their acceptance.

340
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,398
But you never cared.

341
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,017
The first day we met,

342
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:44,998
there we were, Allsafe's
most important clients

343
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:49,062
roaming through the office,
and you couldn't care less.

344
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,344
We're gonna die out here.

345
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:03,348
Maybe not tonight, but soon.

346
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,875
The Dark Army soldier,

347
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:09,336
he's likely reported back by now.

348
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:12,214
It's only a matter of
time before they find us.

349
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,203
Did you hear that?

350
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,647
If there's traffic, we
gotta be close to town.

351
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,598
- Hey!
- Hey!

352
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,838
- Hey!
- Hey!

353
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:54,107
- Hey!
- Hey!

354
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:00,113
Jesus Christ!

355
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:14,798
So what's with the getup

356
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:19,239
Mall Santa? Salvation Army?

357
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:21,759
Sloan Kettering.

358
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,429
It's a cancer center.

359
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,050
I do it for the kids.

360
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:30,429
Dude, that's dope.

361
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:35,619
You're definitely a
better person than me.

362
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:38,383
So what, the kids served spiked nog?

363
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:42,638
No, me and some of the other volunteers,

364
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,726
we got a little tradition
after visiting the hospital.

365
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,395
What's that?

366
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:51,831
We get drunk.

367
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,793
Nice tradition, I guess.

368
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:59,464
Yeah, you know the kids,

369
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:02,658
they love when we drop by.

370
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,472
So many smiling faces.

371
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:12,251
This might be the last
time I do it though.

372
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:15,522
You know, the thing
that really gets you?

373
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:20,335
Some of 'em are so small.

374
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:29,661
It's almost as if they
were just born to die.

375
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:35,024
Jesus.

376
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,943
No wonder you're plastered.

377
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:41,506
How else do you get through that?

378
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:46,035
Well, it was easier when
my wife went with me,

379
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,454
but...

380
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:51,349
since the accident...

381
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,529
What do you got there, Tobias?

382
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:09,058
Oh, I like to keep a nip or two on me

383
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,848
during the holidays.

384
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:13,118
I'm not talking about the booze.

385
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:16,814
Oh, Percocet.

386
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:26,217
Sometimes the... the
pain's just too much.

387
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,891
Alexa, play "slow jams" playlist.

388
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,709
Playing "slow jams" playlist.

389
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:39,546
So this is my apartment.

390
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,928
You know, when we were chatting,

391
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,574
I just imagined this super organized.

392
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,077
Well, I... I actually
did clean up earlier.

393
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,105
No, I like it.

394
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:59,525
♪ Maybe even you ♪

395
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:05,906
You want a drink?

396
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:09,284
I have one Tecate.

397
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,262
We can share.

398
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:13,765

399
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,083

00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,880

♪ Maybe never with you ♪

403
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:29,446
So my apartment being organized

404
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:32,099
was part of your fantasy in our chat?

405
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:36,621
Well, you know, just visualizing.

406
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:42,460
I guess that's the thing about IRC.

407
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:45,237
Everyone gets to imagine
exactly what they want.

408
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:49,158
♪ Total control ♪

409
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,453
Is that why you do it?

410
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:55,122
I like how I can control everything.

411
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:00,419
♪ Over you ♪

412
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,981
♪ Total control over you ♪

413
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,484
I have this fantasy that
I'm the only person from IRC

414
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,820
you've ever invited over.

415
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,264
♪ Over you ♪

416
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,158

let me just...

421
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,222
I'll be right back.

422
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:56,058
Okay.

423
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,185

424
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:01,038

Stop fighting so hard.

429
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,228
You're gonna lose
control faster that way.

430
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:44,523
Give into it.

431
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:46,918
Give up control.

432
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:54,198
Realize you'll never be free.

433
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:18,779
_

434
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:46,500
_

435
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:02,267
Um...

436
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:05,354
Tobias?

437
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:07,331
What's up?

438
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,503
Hold on now.

439
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:15,328
Whose car is that?

440
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,846
That was gonna be my question.

441
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,533
Hey.

442
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:22,388
That's my car.

443
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:28,377
Oh, I get it now.

444
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:32,189
Uh, you see, I didn't drive today.

445
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,555
Kenny drove.

446
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,393
- He picked me up at...
- Okay, Tobias.

447
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:41,423
If that is your car, whose car is this?

448
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:45,105
I have no clue.

449
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,144
Christmas, huh?

450
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:56,088
Good-bye, Tobias.

451
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:01,469
Good-bye is short and final.

452
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,594
Hey. Hey.

453
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,513
Hey.

454
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:22,907
Look,

455
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:25,767
I know it might not be my place, but...

456
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,746
I wanna help you.

457
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,892
You wanna help me?

458
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,029
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

459
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:39,740
Holy crow, what the heck
are you talking about?

460
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:41,759
What do you mean,
you're all sad and lonely

461
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,113
going on about Jimmy,
your suicidal "friend."

462
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,454
Jimmy Stewart.

463
00:32:46,457 --> 00:32:48,099
"It's a Wonderful Life."

464
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,395
Christmas classic.

465
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,296
Tobias, you just told
me good-bye is final.

466
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,462
That is Steinbeck.

467
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:57,382
He's a national treasure. Read a book.

468
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:59,127
Okay, what about the pills?

469
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,136
Okay, you're drunk as shit and
you have a bottle of Percocet.

470
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:04,421
Explain that.

471
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:05,937
For my wife.

472
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,356
Your wife's dead.

473
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:12,790
My wife is dead?

474
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,376
Wait... you said she had an accident.

475
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,654
She threw her back out

476
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:24,791
when we were putting the
Santa on the roof yesterday.

477
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,137
She's in brutal pain.

478
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,247
She can barely move.

479
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:30,582
Doc wrote a prescription...

480
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:33,310
Okay, you fucking scared me.

481
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,423
- Hey, Dolly.
- Darlene.

482
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:41,426
Are you okay?

483
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,696
Yeah, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be?

484
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:48,975
You wanna talk about it?

485
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,162
There's nothing to talk about.

486
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:54,444
You sure?

487
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,585
Yes.

488
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,780
All right.

489
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,949
Have a great night.

490
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,830
Fine.

491
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,462
I have lost absolutely everyone,

492
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:21,174
my boyfriend, my best
friend, my parents.

493
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:23,301
The only one I have left is my brother,

494
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:28,306
who is an asshole that
treats me like absolute shit.

495
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:30,725
But I'm really worried
about him right now,

496
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:32,536
and it pisses me off that I'm worried,

497
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,147
because I am always worried about him,

498
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,810
and he flat-out told me to fuck off.

499
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:39,788
So why do I bother?

500
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:45,198
I don't know.

501
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,552
I don't know, I'm afraid
this time it's different.

502
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,055
I'm afraid he might be dead.

503
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,315
Okay.

504
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,377
- Reception?
- No.

505
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,214
Time.

506
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:30,136
Just realizing it's Christmas.

507
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,789
- Can't be much further.
- To what?

508
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,509
Town.

509
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,143
Let's stop lying to ourselves.

510
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,605
We're nowhere near town.
We're completely lost.

511
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,016
- We just gotta keep moving.
- Why?

512
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,610
Even if we magically made it
to this Pike's Hollow place,

513
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,854
the town is gonna be
swarming with Dark Army.

514
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:52,191
- We've gotta try.
- You aren't listening to me.

515
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:55,536
Whatever we're walking
towards, it ends with death.

516
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:09,258
What are you doing?

517
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,846
There's a rock in my shoe.

518
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:36,035
You honestly don't
care about me, do you?

519
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:39,202
What are you talking about now?

520
00:36:39,205 --> 00:36:42,206
Like why you wear that
same hoodie every day.

521
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:45,317
You don't care.

522
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,654
Did you ever care about me?

523
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,340
I mean, be honest, I can take it.

524
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,748
What is the point of this?

525
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,968
Just answer the question, did you?

526
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:55,567
Tyrell, you didn't make it easy...

527
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,999
- Just answer the question!
- No!

528
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,428
The sound of death.

529
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:09,869
It's just some stupid animal. Let's go.

530
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,175
- Go without me.
- What?

531
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,938
- You're giving up?
- Yeah.

532
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:17,691
I think so.

533
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,538
I can't deal with this shit anymore.

534
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,632
Come on.

535
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,876
You stay out here alone,

536
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:46,138
you can be sure it's game over.

537
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,587
You're better than this.

538
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,809
Yeah, maybe I was, but not anymore.

539
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,095
I'm going.

540
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,981
Yeah, go, Elliot.

541
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,725
- I will.
- Yeah, good.

542
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,560
'Cause you don't need
me. You never needed me.

543
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:01,686
That's the truth, right?

544
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:05,273
Yeah, that's the truth, I
never fucking needed you!

545
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,155
You were only in the way!

546
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,276
If it weren't for you...

547
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:11,237
The world would've been saved?

548
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,757
And you would have been the savior?

549
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,450
Is that what you think?

550
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:17,786
Is that the fantasy I ruined for you?

551
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:20,121
Stay here, die!

552
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:23,625
I don't give a fuck about you!

553
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:25,853
I'm done!

554
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:29,749
Good!

555
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,132
Look around you!

556
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:36,280
All signs lead to the
same hopeless destination,

557
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:39,140
and the sooner you
realize that, the better,

558
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:41,064
for you're so much in your own head

559
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,067
that you can't see the truth!

560
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,004
That it's over!

561
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,626
Seems like we're always
thinking of ourselves

562
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,488
when looking for something that's lost,

563
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,158
but we never think much about the lost,

564
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,712
whatever, whoever is unable to be found,

565
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,958
whether it's a set of keys
left somewhere and forgotten,

566
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,254
a couple of guys wandering
aimlessly in the woods,

567
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:12,648
or someone who's
disappeared inside himself.

568
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,894
What if that's what
they wanted all along?

569
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,263
Not to be found.

570
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:38,491
You're wrong.

571
00:39:38,493 --> 00:39:40,803
I don't like being an outsider either.

572
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:44,723
Maybe I'm just good at hiding it.

573
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:50,062
Why'd you come back?
Why aren't you going?

574
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:53,840
I don't know.

575
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:56,050
I guess...

576
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:57,986
it felt wrong to leave you.

577
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,391
Besides,

578
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:05,277
I think you're the only person I know

579
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,246
that actually likes me.

580
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,626
You were right about one thing.

581
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:16,120
I've known that we're gonna die

582
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,800
since we walked out of that gas
station and the van was gone.

583
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:24,042
I don't think there's a
way out of this for us.

584
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,957
Why do you want to keep going?

585
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:31,687
My sister.

586
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:35,507
I have to warn her.

587
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:39,260
I have to at least try.

588
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:42,096
I got her into this miss.

589
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:45,817
Same as last time and
the time before that.

590
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,769
I've been a horrible brother.

591
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,955
I treated her like shit.

592
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,899
Least I can do

593
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,944
is call her and tell her to run.

594
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,284
Maybe she can still escape.

595
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,627
How much longer do you
think until they find us?

596
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,605
I don't know, man.

597
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,989
All right.

598
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:28,977
Let's keep moving.

599
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:31,980
Maybe you can still
make that phone call.

600
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:50,641
- Dolly.
- Dar... what?

601
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:53,745
I know you're worried
about your brother,

602
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:57,217
but you gotta worry about you too.

603
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:02,091
I'm trying.

604
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:05,077
And I hope he's not dead.

605
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,824
Merry Christmas.

606
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:14,739
Hi.

607
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,741
Ho, ho, ho.

608
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,860
Santa's home.

609
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,671
Fu...

610
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,565
Tyrell.

611
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:31,945
You okay?

612
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,615
Oh, Jesus Christ.

613
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,917
I'm okay.

614
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,422
We can't just leave him here.

615
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:58,579
Gotta get you to a hospital, man.

616
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:01,165
Fuck.

617
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,635
No... no hospital.

618
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:06,271
The Dark Army will find
me; they'll find you.

619
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:12,977
No... no, we gotta keep moving, man.

620
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,763
We'll find someplace that can help you.

621
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:17,783
No, I'm done.

622
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:22,621
Burn the van and all the evidence.

623
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:30,736
Make sure you take care of Whiterose.

624
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:32,446
Okay?

625
00:46:38,955 --> 00:46:40,639
Tyrell.

626
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:48,897
I can't let you die.

627
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,944
I'm just gonna go for a walk.
