1
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:08,908
Unless you go to work
tomorrow, I'm gonna be forced

2
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,265
to do something very
bad to your mother.

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:12,257
Give me your phone.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,694
I rigged Signal's API

5
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:16,175
to beam GPS coords so
we can share locations.

6
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:18,967
My whole life is ruined because of you.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,495
All you deserve is pure and utter agony.

8
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:23,393
Olivia was Susan Jacobs' contact.

9
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,487
She's an addict.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,460
If she gets caught
using, she loses her kid.

11
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm not like most people.

12
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:29,027
I'm starting to pick up on that.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,410
My mom got killed. Murdered, actually.

14
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:33,321
Olivia's access isn't good enough.

15
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,652
You know why we came back here, right?

16
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:35,898
So you could be king of New York.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,686
And in order for our
kingdom to be built,

18
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,227
I need a brilliant architect.

19
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,112
- I'm trying to help him.
- You're trying to destroy me.

20
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,706
I'm done talking to you.

21
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,209
One of your patients hacked me.

22
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,787
- Krista.
- I don't feel safe around you.

23
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,590
She knows something I gotta know.

24
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,480
It's time we talked.

25
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,556
I'm gonna tell you a story.

26
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,403
A story of a true "Xmas" miracle.

27
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:04,136
This is the tale of a bully

28
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:06,281
and a little bitch.

29
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,644
I'm talking about a mean, nasty bully

30
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:13,814
and a scrawny-ass little bitch.

31
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,525
This bully would pick
on the little bitch

32
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,790
every day after school.

33
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:20,621
If little bitch had cash,
little bitch got robbed.

34
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,216
If little bitch bowed up,

35
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:25,367
little bitch got stomped.

36
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,558
Point I'm trying to make here is,

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,728
this bully owned that bitch
like a Lincoln Continental,

38
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,340
but something happened to change it all.

39
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:44,737
On this Xmas of our tale,

40
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,908
little bitch got lucky
with the gifts, see?

41
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,435
Something little bitch
loved more than anything...

42
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:56,899
before family, God, and country was...

43
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:59,693
baseball.

44
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,404
Loved the shit out of it.

45
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:04,165
Well,

46
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,283
on this Xmas morning

47
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:09,745
when he got out of his little bedroom

48
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:13,507
and looked under his little tree,

49
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,768
guess what he found.

50
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:23,860
An Easton Magnum aluminum baseball bat.

51
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,221
Little bitch grabbed that bat

52
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,974
and went right outside to play.

53
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:34,311
Didn't even take the bow
off, he was so excited.

54
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:37,290
And there he was on
the corner ball field,

55
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:40,068
hitting balls like he was Sammy Sosa

56
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,795
when...

57
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:45,873
his bully comes up,

58
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,758
eyeing that bat.

59
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:55,249
And just as the bully
made his way up to him,

60
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:58,644
without any warning...

61
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,980
bam!

62
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,890
Blood.

63
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:06,343
Fuckin' everywhere.

64
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:08,512
Blood on the ground,

65
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:11,157
blood on little bitch,

66
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,286
blood dripping down the bow
still wrapped around that bat.

67
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,240
Little bitch knocked every tooth out

68
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,483
of that motherfucker's head.

69
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,652
Cracked his skull open,

70
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:26,989
popped his eyeball out on home plate.

71
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,265
All because little bitch saw the truth.

72
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,762
That bat may have
been made to play ball,

73
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,858
but that wasn't its purpose.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,468
Nuh-uh.

75
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,346
In that moment in little bitch's hands,

76
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:54,367
it was there to break
this nigga's head open.

77
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,358
See, Ms. Krista,

78
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,487
we all have a purpose in this world,

79
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,325
and it's our lot in life
to wait for the cosmos

80
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,994
to reveal what that is.

81
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,669
But you don't have to look no more...

82
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,643
'Cause for you, that day has come.

83
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,515
Want to know why?

84
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:44,658
I'm gonna break Elliot...

85
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,569
and you gonna be my aluminum bat.

87
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,107
I'm, uh... I'm on my
way to Olivia's now.

88
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,850
How are we gonna get to her boss?

89
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,352
We still need his login credentials

90
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,778
to transfer the money.

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,614
Don't worry about it. I have a plan.

92
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,393
Did the proxy hack at
Virtual Realty check out?

93
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,217
Yeah, we're good.

94
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,106
I'm seeing all the
unencrypted network traffic.

95
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,700
What about the venue for
this Deus Group shindig?

96
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,127
Do we know where it's going down?

97
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,037
Uh, Price sent me the location.

98
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,072
It should be in your inbox.

99
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,740
There's a hotel across the street

100
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:36,043
that we should work out of.

101
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,915
Are you there?

102
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,625
Darlene?

103
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:46,812
Yeah.

104
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,591
The other day, when...

105
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:56,471
I said that I should never
have let you back in my life...

106
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,825
I was an asshole.

107
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,936
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:06,857
You still have my Signal mod
running on your phone, right?

109
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,484
Yeah, why?

110
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:12,411
Just be careful, okay?

111
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,490
Keep your phone on you so
I can see where you are.

112
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,636
I don't want to lose you again.

113
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,625
Oh, thank you.

114
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,502
I... I got to go.

115
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,895
Elli.

116
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:48,449
Ah, long time no see, cuz.

117
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,042
Where do I know this place from?

118
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,902
Do you have it?

119
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:53,879
Of course I got it, bro.

120
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,535
Under the table.

121
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,803
Where you going?

122
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,392
I got to go.

123
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:13,924
Damn, you just gon' leave like that?

124
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,809
Thought we gonna catch up.

125
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,237
Sorry, man, I... I got shit to do.

126
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:23,409
Listen, just so you know,
I'm full-time freelance now.

127
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,936
Only loyalty is to the almighty paper.

128
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,246
So hang on to my number.

129
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,939
Should you need anything,

130
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,525
you know I'm your guy.

131
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,026
You be strange, now,

132
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,171
but don't be a stranger,
know what I mean?

133
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,969
Peace, Elli.

134
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,759
We don't have to do this.

135
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:00,382
We can find a way to talk to her.

136
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:01,855
And if she says no?

137
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,690
Then we reason with her.

138
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,527
And if she still says no?

139
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,529
We don't have time for taking risks.

140
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,273
This is the only way.

141
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:15,869
Hey. What you're about
to do is crossing a line.

142
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,756
Well, it's a little late
for that, don't you think?

143
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,826
He's right.

144
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:24,107
We used to have a code.

145
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,714
Lines we would not
cross, parameters we set.

146
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,625
Those seem to have been
seriously modified.

147
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:34,146
Question is, can we bring
those boundaries back?

148
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,066
Or is it like he said, too late?

149
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,894
Two large peppermint mochas.

150
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,657
What were you doing in
Pike's Hollow this morning?

151
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,004
How did you get in here?

152
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,205
Where's your brother?

153
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,875
Did you take him somewhere?

154
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,796
Is he still in the city?

155
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,937
Okay.

156
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:18,006
Fuck, Darlene, you
should have kept driving.

157
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,674
Who are you calling?

158
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:21,935
You can't call this in to the FBI.

159
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,862
If the Dark Army finds
out about that crime scene,

160
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:24,863
they're gonna send someone...

161
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,157
They already did.

162
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,812
Have a seat.

163
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,948
A guy who continually talks

164
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,490
to an invisible entity
that isn't there...

165
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,194
Has arguments with him.

166
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,288
The invisible entity
interrupts him sometimes.

167
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,868
- Clorox.
- Market.

168
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,829
- How may I help you?
- I have her.

169
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,058
Oh, well done.

170
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,135
And her brother?

171
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,254
No, and she's not giving him up.

172
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,641
Uh-huh.

173
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,902
Well, that's not great.

174
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,739
Keep her close. Let me
run it up the flagpole.

175
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,490
Call you back in a bit.

176
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,685
Return of a biblical prophet,

177
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,186
Jan Matthys is preaching

178
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,306
death and repentance
before the Second Coming,

179
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,576
and those who are not part
of the chosen people...

180
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:17,750
Hello, sweetheart.

181
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,332
Are going to be horribly killed.

182
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,860
I brought peppermint mochas.

183
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,294
They said it was Christmas in a cup.

184
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,564
Well, it is indeed Christmas.

185
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,418
Very sweet.

186
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,455
Do you want to come in?

187
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,957
Yeah.

188
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,709
Okay.

189
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:23,023
What I'm about to tell
you is gonna sound...

190
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,778
A little crazy.

191
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,283
What's up?

192
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,481
It's about your clients.

193
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,834
My clients?

194
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,746
At Cyprus National Bank.

195
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,853
I never told you where I work.

196
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:03,046
A bank that primarily does business

197
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,858
with the Deus Group.

198
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Whoa.

199
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,552
What the fuck is this?

200
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,554
They're a criminal enterprise

201
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,366
that uses their power and
wealth to run the world

202
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,459
without anyone knowing it.

203
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,104
Okay, I don't know why you're...

204
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:22,707
Tiananmen Square,
civil war in the Congo,

205
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,544
both Iraq wars,

206
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:28,380
the paramilitary
massacre in El Salado...

207
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,386
The cyber bombings.

208
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,412
That's not even their top five.

209
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,226
Okay...

210
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,754
You're really starting to scare me.

211
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:48,114
Tell me what you're doing.
Why do you know where I work?

212
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,553
I hacked you.

213
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:53,363
Excuse me?

214
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,909
I hacked you.

215
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,021
Why?

216
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,541
I need you to do something for me.

217
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,111
What... what is this?

218
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:11,590
I need you to make one
phone call to your boss.

219
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,759
I'm already on their proxy server.

220
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,917
I just need him to log in so
I can swipe his credentials.

221
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:21,341
I know this doesn't make
sense to you right now,

222
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,961
but trust me, Olivia...

223
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:27,547
they're using you.

224
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:30,592
They're using me?

225
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:34,470
They are, but I can stop them.

226
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,949
I can stop them once and for all.

227
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,726
All I need is one phone call from you.

228
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,549
Get out.

229
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:51,964
- Don't do this.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

230
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,800
This conversation's over.

231
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:57,711
Get the fuck out.

232
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,412
Now.

233
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,580
What happens if you fail a drug test?

234
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,702
What did you say?

235
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:42,121
I know about your custody battle.

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,711
If you test positive for Oxy...

237
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,096
What the fuck are you talking about?

238
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,131
I'm eight years clean.

239
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,937
No, you're not.

240
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,871
You drugged me?

241
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:31,137
I had to make sure you would listen.

242
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,418
You're gonna call your boss in Cyprus.

243
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:35,897
You're gonna get him to
log in to the bank website,

244
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,477
and that's it.

245
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,012
Then I'm gone.

246
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,084
If you don't do what I say...

247
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:54,861
you lose your son.

248
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,040
Why are you doing this?

249
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,107
I was running out of time.

250
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,053
This was the fastest
way to convince you.

251
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,146
This was taken one mile

252
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,198
from where the van
following Mr. Alderson

253
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,067
was found burned.

254
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,461
We have his sister,

255
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,131
but we're still searching for him.

256
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,801
The minute we find him,

257
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,827
I think...

258
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,016
You think what?

259
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,646
It's time, Minister Zhang.

260
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,339
He's too much of a liability.

261
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,316
Oh, you're being foolish.

262
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,399
If we kill him,

263
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,515
his shipping hack dies with him.

264
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,328
We have the Deus Group meeting tonight.

265
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:06,163
Think about what you're saying.

266
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,233
The entire membership will be there.

267
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,264
It's too risky.

268
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,753
I will not get this close

269
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:14,690
only to watch it slip away again.

270
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:17,077
I want you to locate Mr. Alderson

271
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,112
and bring him in.

272
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:21,173
He should see the full potential

273
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,750
of what we're working towards.

274
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:31,183
It's time he learns
we're on the same side.

275
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,813
- Placemat.
- Bandit.

276
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,541
How's everything over there?

277
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,547
- Fine.
- Good news and bad news.

278
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,863
The higher-ups want
Elliot, not his sister.

279
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,866
I don't suppose she's
mentioned where he is yet?

280
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:07,219
She wouldn't do that.

281
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,295
I heard her talking
to him earlier, though.

282
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,855
We can get his location off her phone.

283
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,881
Oh, interesting.

284
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,709
And you have her phone, I assume.

285
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:17,729
Yeah, I got it right
here, so we don't need her.

286
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,155
Fantastic.

287
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:22,359
Well, then, I'll be there with
my team to collect the phone.

288
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,873
And her?

289
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,780
Kill her.

290
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,508
What?

291
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,526
You said it yourself. We don't need her.

292
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,445
Cleaner this way.

293
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,410
You can handle that, right?

294
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,745
Mm-hmm.

295
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,455
Because I recall the last time

296
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:53,789
you didn't feel 100...

297
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,958
No.

298
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,334
I'm fine.

299
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,921
I'm just saying, if you don't feel 100%

300
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:02,548
like last time, you should
let me know right now

301
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,700
so I can set aside the time

302
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,413
to kill your mother
and your entire family.

303
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,221
No.

304
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:09,689
I can handle it.

305
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,768
Great. I'll be there at 3:30 on the dot.

306
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,662
Make sure it's done by then.

307
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:19,315
What?

308
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,635
What did they say?

309
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,219
Fuck! What the fuck?

310
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,255
Wait!

311
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,966
Wait! Fucking wait!

312
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:46,968
Get up!

313
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,565
What the fuck are you doing?

314
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,267
Keeping my family safe.

315
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:55,660
On your knees!

316
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:05,337
So this is it, then?

317
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,822
They tell you to kill me,
and you're just gonna do it?

318
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,282
Your phone gives them Elliot's location,

319
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,174
so they don't need you.

320
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,285
This is crazy. This isn't you, Dom!

321
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,892
You don't need to fucking do this!

322
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,821
I can't believe you have
the balls to say that.

323
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:17,039
You ruined my life.

324
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,457
I did. I'll own that, okay?

325
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,534
But that doesn't make you this!

326
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:22,017
You don't just fucking
shoot people in cold blood!

327
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,672
- I'm here because of you.
- I know.

328
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,859
- You did this to me!
- I know!

329
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,677
Okay, you were right.

330
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,679
Okay? I was wrong.

331
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,472
Give me a chance to make it right.

332
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:35,558
I can get you out of this.

333
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,518
- There's no way out.
- I have a plan.

334
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,220
You think I give a shit about your plan?

335
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,468
We are gonna take down the
Dark Army once and for all.

336
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,482
It's happening tonight.

337
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:45,860
It's too late.

338
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,508
Please, Dom, it's not too late.

339
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,010
No, it has to be like this.

340
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,408
There's not enough time. It's too late.

341
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,737
- Dom, listen to me!
- They coming at 3:30.

342
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,959
Listen to me. I know I fucked up, okay?

343
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,873
But it's not too late.

344
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,416
If you let me go, I can stop this, okay?

345
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,564
I swear to God, if you just let me go.

346
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,379
- Please!
- I'm sorry.

347
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,401
No, no, no, please!

348
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,885
Don't be sorry, Dom.

349
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,178
Don't be, don't be!

350
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,992
Don't be sorry, Dom, okay?
Please, Dom, don't be sorry.

351
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:18,325
You don't need to do this.
You are a good person!

352
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,537
- This isn't you!
- Shut up!

353
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,445
Shit, shit, shit.

354
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,757
Shit.

355
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,468
How soon can he get back to me?

356
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,972
It's urgent, yes.

357
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,458
I know, but it's
regarding Mr. Kuklachev.

358
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,936
He'll want to know.

359
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:48,648
Okay, great.

360
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,527
Merry Christmas.

361
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,393
How long do you think it'll be?

362
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,812
Fuck you.

363
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:11,487
My life is over. I
want you to know that.

364
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:12,905
You just have to talk to him.

365
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,324
Then I'll go.

366
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:17,844
Nothing will be traced to you.

367
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,806
And you think that's it, huh?

368
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,685
You just drugged an addict.

369
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:29,839
You'll get through it.

370
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:32,484
You arrogant piece of shit.

371
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,113
Maybe you can have a slip

372
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:38,681
and it's not the end of
the world, but I can't.

373
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:41,684
It destroys me.

374
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,578
So fuck you.

375
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,205
Maybe you should have thought about that

376
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,026
before you worked for them.

377
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,880
What's that supposed to mean?

378
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:59,493
Offshore bank in Cyprus.

379
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,971
Kind of money that goes through there.

380
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,040
You know, come on.

381
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,877
You're not dumb.

382
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,129
I'm sure a part of you has always known.

383
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:12,631
You chose to look the other way.

384
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,551
My choices are none of your business.

385
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:17,720
I get it.

386
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,939
You needed a job. They were paying well.

387
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:22,700
That's how they do it.
That's their business model.

388
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,728
They back everyone into a corner

389
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,374
until all that's left is for
us to compromise ourselves.

390
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:33,819
That's why what I'm
doing has to be done.

391
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:36,989
They're hurting you...

392
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:38,991
just like they're hurting all of us.

393
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:42,554
The only one hurting me right now is you.

394
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,585
I wonder how many
people you've had to hurt

395
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:52,213
to get what you want.

396
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:53,940
Hmm?

397
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,486
How many has it been, Elliot?

398
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,682
How many people have had to suffer

399
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:05,785
because of you?

400
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:15,420
Was it worth it?

401
00:24:31,546 --> 00:24:34,147
I'm a mess.

402
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,109
Can I use the bathroom?

403
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,905
Yeah, go ahead.

404
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,571
So was fucking me part of the plan,

405
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:00,882
or was that just a happy accident?

406
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:05,136
It was an accident.

407
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:12,852
That's sweet.

408
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:34,148
It's almost done.

409
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,360
Once her boss calls back,
we'll get what we need and go.

410
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,293
This would have all been simpler

411
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:49,204
if she wasn't so deep in denial
about who she's working for.

412
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,208
There it is.

413
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,794
That sense of dread.

414
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,048
It only happens when you cross a line

415
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,843
you didn't even know existed.

416
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,387
Maybe that dread is a good thing.

417
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:15,564
After all, when you realize
you've crossed a line...

418
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,877
That means you still had one.

419
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:26,075
When those crossed lines
are all behind you,

420
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:28,869
up ahead is only darkness.

421
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:34,208
He has insomnia,

422
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,668
social anxiety.

423
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,836
I... I don't know what else to tell you.

424
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:41,715
Morphine addiction,
jail time, dead daddy.

425
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:45,052
You're giving me the knockoffs, girl.

426
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,904
I want the brand name.

427
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:53,227
Please let me go.

428
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:56,021
Whatever you're looking
for, I don't have it.

429
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:59,942
I know the two of you had
a special relationship.

430
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:06,090
"Special"?

431
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,367
He hacked me.

432
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,703
He threatened my last boyfriend.

433
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,955
He threatened me.

434
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,456
You know, I had to stop seeing him

435
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,791
because he scared me so much.

436
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:18,252
You weren't scared of him!

437
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:20,605
You loved his ass!

438
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,929
I saw the look on your face.

439
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,823
Don't lie to me.

440
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:37,062
This isn't going to work.

441
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:40,124
Your outbursts.

442
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,110
Just because you were bullied as a kid,

443
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:46,706
because people hurt you...

444
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,574
until that day you swung a bat

445
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:51,952
and learned how to hurt them back...

446
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:55,640
doesn't mean it's going to work with me.

447
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,696
W-wait a minute.

448
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,367
Wait a fucking second.

449
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:19,238
Miss Krista, are you...

450
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,833
are you calling me a little bitch?

451
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,172
Yo, Peanuts.

452
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:31,366
You hear that, what she called me?

453
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:33,327
She called you a little bitch.

454
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,996
Hey, Javi.

455
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,182
You hear her calling me a little bitch?

456
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,143
That's what I heard.

457
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,134
See?

458
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,470
That's why you're good.

459
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:54,848
Not even my bitch can
call me a little bitch.

460
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,017
Oh, my God!

461
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,899
- Who's that?
- Jason.

462
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,030
Jason, huh?

463
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:15,369
That your boy?

464
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:18,798
Maybe we should bring him in here.

465
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,241
Maybe that's what'll...
what'll get you going.

466
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,045
Hello, babe.

467
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,419
Are you in there?

468
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,807
How about that, Miss Krista?

469
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,217
We gon' have one big merry-merry.

470
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,901
I was able to stop the bleeding.

471
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:59,388
Gonna be okay.

472
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,401
I'm sorry.

473
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:24,872
I don't believe you.

474
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:58,138
You said the people I work for...

475
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,905
They were behind the
massacre in El Salado?

476
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:16,657
My mom died there.

477
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:21,328
I know.

478
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,597
Olivia...

479
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:38,529
I can stop them.

480
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,326
Hi.

481
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,997
Um, I'm sorry to
bother you on a holiday,

482
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:08,726
but Mr. Kuklachev
needs the authorization

483
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:11,169
to transfer funds.

484
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:20,012
You don't see the request?

485
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:21,197
Are you sure?

486
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:37,863
I still don't see it.

487
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:39,757
Okay, that's strange.

488
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,868
He said it was urgent.

489
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,245
Maybe he changed his mind.

490
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,039
I'll just...

491
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:50,751
I'll just check back with him
and... and get back to you.

492
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:56,048
Okay, thanks.

493
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,261
Merry Christmas to you too.

494
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,725
I'll wipe all the traces of you

495
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:09,620
and your boss's involvement.

496
00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:11,697
Nothing will be linked back to you.

497
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,037
You know, I may work for monsters...

498
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:26,262
But you are one.

499
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:32,717
And you're the worst kind,
because you don't even know it.

500
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:08,253
Oh, damn.

501
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,389
Your boy's upset you didn't let him in.

502
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:20,132
Ah, all right.

503
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:29,366
Now...

504
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,352
before your boy came and went,

505
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:34,354
you were calling me a little bitch?

506
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:40,068
Chill, girl.

507
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,154
I didn't take no offense.

508
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:45,031
In fact, this was my bad,

509
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,792
'cause I didn't tell
you the whole story.

510
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,034
See,

511
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:52,164
I was just explaining your role to you.

512
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,800
That you my bat.

513
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:00,338
But that bat ain't the end of the story.

514
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,308
Nah.

515
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,811
That's where I come in.

516
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,352
So after being beaten

517
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:16,563
within an inch of his life

518
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:21,752
by that badass little bitch,

519
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:24,421
the bully woke up in the hospital.

520
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:29,242
It was right then when
little bitch walked in

521
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:32,954
like the fucking ghost of Xmas past.

522
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,773
Bully sees him and starts crying.

523
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,050
I mean, this nigga was scared.

524
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:39,211
He must have thought that boy
had come to finish him off.

525
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:44,090
But you know what happened?

526
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:50,597
Little bitch just walked right up

527
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,475
to his bully's bed...

528
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:00,106
And held his hand.

529
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,959
Yep.

530
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:03,752
He held his hand...

531
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:08,373
Just like so.

532
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:14,120
Real soft and gentle-like.

533
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:17,749
And then he got real close.

534
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:24,005
He looks at his bully,

535
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:27,592
all sniffling and crying.

536
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:30,062
He looked at him and said...

537
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,475
"I see you now."

538
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,484
Little bitch showed up
when no one else would.

539
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:46,570
He saw his bully

540
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:50,249
like no one else could...

541
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,010
and that was all it took.

542
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:55,179
And, Miss Krista,

543
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,923
from that moment on,

544
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,209
he owned that bully for life.

545
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:09,843
Now, if I want to own Elliot,
I don't just gotta break him.

546
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:12,026
Me and Elliot are linked

547
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,472
on a spiritual plane.

548
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:17,350
I got to come at him on the
same level I find myself,

549
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:20,112
and... and breaking him
only gets you so far.

550
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:23,523
I gotta break him so I can build him up.

551
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:24,983
I need to wound his soul

552
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,626
so I can be the one to heal him.

553
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:29,288
That is how you own a nigga.

554
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,126
Now, the next words out of your mouth

555
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,369
have to be exactly what I want.

556
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:37,963
Not for my sake,

557
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:41,666
but for yours and for your boy Jason,

558
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:44,970
who lives up on 1404 Jay Street.

559
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,484
Now, you know what I want.

560
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:54,387
You got to give it to me.

561
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:04,990
You do that,

562
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,234
I got no reason not to turn you loose.

563
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,075
Look me in my eye.

564
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,082
Trust me.

565
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:49,401
Go to the filing cabinet in my office.

566
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:54,739
There's a folder in the bottom drawer.

567
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:01,213
Go to the tab that
says "September 2015."

568
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,127
Look for Elliot's name.

569
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,737
What am I gonna find there?

570
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:34,246
Mr. Robot.

571
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,750
What's that?

572
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,514
That...

573
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:46,291
is how you'll break him.

574
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,204
Oh, my head hurts.

575
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,538
I thought you were gonna kill me.

576
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,683
They gave me an hour.

577
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,316
How long has it been?

578
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,070
Just unlock your phone.

579
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:43,365
All they want is Elliot's location.

580
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,726
- I can't.
- You can.

581
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:48,773
What would you do if it was your family?

582
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:50,539
I'm doing it.

583
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:04,595
You know that night we spent together?

584
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:07,839
I know you probably think of it

585
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,434
as the worst night of your life...

586
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,711
The night all this shit went to shit.

587
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:16,589
But when I think about it, it was...

588
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:19,276
Don't.

589
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,278
Nice.

590
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,765
The last time I remember
actually feeling good.

591
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:33,207
You were just using me.

592
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:37,252
You know it was more than that.

593
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:48,621
Look...

594
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:52,142
whatever you have to do, I get it.

595
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:56,629
Okay? But just... just
at least believe that.

596
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:14,272
I'm out of time.

597
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:25,217
Get up.

598
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,996
- Where are we going?
- Come on, get up.

599
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:31,848
- Where are we going?
- Up.

600
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,708
Come on, let's go.

601
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:38,930
You got the jump on me,

602
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,630
and before I knew what
was happening, it was over.

603
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:42,550
What are you talking about?

604
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:45,803
Take it and make it quick.

605
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:47,698
- You want me to shoot you?
- It's the only way.

606
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,514
Come on, we're running out of time.

607
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,497
You have to kill me.

608
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,017
I'm not fucking killing you, okay?

609
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,518
Let's go. We can make a run for it.

610
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,811
If they show up and we're gone,

611
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:55,205
my family's dead.

612
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:56,856
Don't you get it?

613
00:42:56,858 --> 00:43:00,377
My life puts everyone I love in danger.

614
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,954
This won't stop until I'm dead.

615
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,715
I'm not gonna fucking kill you.

616
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:06,740
I'd do it myself if I could.

617
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:08,837
I've thought about it every
day for the past two months,

618
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:09,961
but I can't do it.

619
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,630
I can't do it.

620
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,731
Please, Darlene, just
pull the fucking trigger.

621
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,766
- I can't.
- Just pull the fucking trigger!

622
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:17,728
- Dom, please.
- Pull the fucking trigger!

623
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:18,932
- I can't.
- Do it!

624
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:27,613
Dominique?

625
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:36,538
Well, now, I was not expecting this.

626
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:39,691
I... I'm stunned.

627
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:41,918
I... I don't know what to say.

628
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,795
My goodness.

629
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:51,703
Oh. Oh, don't worry,
I'm not gonna kill you.

630
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:54,348
You are still far too
useful to us for that.

631
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,252
But this is going to be

632
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:03,565
so painful for you.

633
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:08,570
Now, where's the phone?

634
00:44:15,936 --> 00:44:18,862
I want you to understand,
I mean you no ill will.

635
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,865
My instructions were
to find your brother.

636
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:21,700
Well, in that case,

637
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:22,942
my phone's not gonna do you any good.

638
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:24,528
I just wiped it.

639
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:37,280
Huh.

640
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,540
Shouldn't we be talking
about what just happened?

641
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,135
We got the access we needed

642
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:46,632
to transfer the money
from the bank's side.

643
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:49,135
Once we hack all of the
members' phones tonight

644
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:51,321
at their meeting, we can rob them blind.

645
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:52,948
That's not what I meant.

646
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:57,494
What you meant doesn't matter.

647
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,985
- Krista?
- Elliot, I need to see you.

648
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,344
I'm actually kind of
busy. Can I call you tomorrow?

649
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:10,177
I was kidnapped by someone you know.

650
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,550
Fernando Vera.

651
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,512
He wanted to know everything
about you, everything I knew.

652
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:17,095
I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do.

653
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:18,699
I didn't have a choice. He had a gun.

654
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:20,278
Once he got what he
wanted, he let me go.

655
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,238
I went to the police,

656
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:23,094
but now I'm too afraid to go back home.

657
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,688
- I'm scared.
- Wait, wait, slow down.

658
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,928
- Where are you right now?
- I'm-I don't know.

659
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:27,979
Downtown, I think.

660
00:45:27,982 --> 00:45:30,182
I can meet you at
Washington Square Park.

661
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,529
- Can you get there?
- I think so.

662
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:34,990
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

663
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:40,036
There's no way he's
just gonna let her go.

664
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,949
I know.

665
00:45:49,697 --> 00:45:52,302
Here we go again, off to play the hero.

666
00:45:52,305 --> 00:45:54,492
But is that even who we are anymore?

667
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,628
You saw what we did back there.

668
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,664
We just watched him
destroy someone's life

669
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,707
and none of us did a thing about it.

670
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:07,675
Rules, morals, parameters...
they only break

671
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:09,507
if you're broken to begin with.

672
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:11,067
Did we change under pressure,

673
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,737
or did this only reveal
who we really are?

674
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,071
I don't know anymore.

675
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,890
- The one thing I do know is...
- Hey, hey!

676
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:23,563
Wait, wait, wait!

677
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,957
Help!

678
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,087
Hey!

679
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,576
Hey, hey!

680
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:29,745
Help!

681
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:33,228
Help!
