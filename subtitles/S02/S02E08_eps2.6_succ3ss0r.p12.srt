1
00:00:00,612 --> 00:00:01,754
What if this all went away?

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,892
The money, this city, all of it?

3
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,780
The world is filled
with stupid people,

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,315
and I get paid a lot to be smart.

5
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,357
Susan Jacobs,

6
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,904
the general counsel at E Corp.

7
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,147
Madam executioner.

8
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,562
The tracking on her phone is working.

9
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,248
How long you think she's
gonna stay away for?

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:20,221
Long enough.

11
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,506
Have you ever considered which part
of our scheme motivates you?

12
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:26,505
The FBI announced today
Tyrell Wellick and fsociety

13
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,979
engaged in this attack.

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,279
Are you alone?

15
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,179
That's called a femtocell.

16
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,407
So we can get every FBI email,

17
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,868
text message, and document.

18
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:39,079
We just owned the FBI.

19
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,165
They have something called
Operation Berenstain.

20
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,508
Possibly heavy surveillance.

21
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:47,195
They're trying to cover their tracks,

22
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,109
and right now, we're the tracks.

23
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:56,644
HAPPY THANKSGIVING
RON'S COFFEE

24
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,766
Go ahead.

25
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,111
Whole milk.

26
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,999
Must be some kind of revolutionary.

27
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,731
No... I...

28
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,560
Just 'cause everyone's into this
almond coconut shit nowadays.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,120
It's...

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,699
not...

31
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,176
What kind of phone do you have?

32
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,104
Oh... this?

33
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:53,856
Yeah, it's... it's a Nexus.

34
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,890
Yeah, I'm an Android guy.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,029
Hate Apple.

36
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,669
Think iPhones are for pussies.

37
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,989
What are you on?

38
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,457
iPhone.

39
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:05,851
Right.

40
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:11,681
You think they suck so
much, but they're faster.

41
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,870
Bullshit.

42
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,608
I mean, if you're talking boot times,

43
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:17,708
then it's Android all day,

44
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,759
and if you're talking net speed,

45
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,773
Chrome on Android has
better HTML5 compliance

46
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:25,350
and runs JavaScript so
much faster than Safari.

47
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,447
No competition.

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,023
Oh, yeah?

49
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:30,958
Prove it.

50
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:33,347
Go to this benchmarking website.

51
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,019
We'll compare speeds.

52
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:39,159
Okay.

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,713
Game on.

54
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,150
Are you on the Wi-Fi here?

55
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,108
- Yes.
(Start hioctane 2.0A)

56
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:50,619
- It's slow as shit.
(Running hioctane...)

57
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,818
Agreed. It's hit or miss.

58
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,777
There's another Ron's Coffee Shop.

59
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,225
Oh, 14th Street. Yeah, I know.

60
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,409
Everyone always Reddits about that one.

61
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,591
Crazy fast.

iPhones suck.

I'm... meeting someone.

70
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,116
What about you?

71
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:23,767
- Same.
- Cool, cool, cool.

Oh, the old malicious

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,789
I see you already own
this newb's whole system.

75
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,319
I like it.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,377
Didn't your mom ever tell
you not to surf websites

77
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,982
that have an embedded
Stagefright exploit?

78
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,052
Can't drop the proverbial soap

79
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,634
around a black-hat bitch
like this, Mobley.

Darlene, I...

81
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,754
I thought I was meeting Elliot.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,465
Me too.

83
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:58,333
Relax, kids, this isn't the
stranger danger episode.

84
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,158
Elliot couldn't make it,
but no need to connip.

85
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,733
I'll download you.

86
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,974
Well, I'm not gonna shout.

87
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:09,373
Get over here, tubs.

88
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:10,855
Don't...

89
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:15,980
Before we start, he wanted
me to read you guys something.

90
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,525
Now, keep in mind these
are his words, not mine.

91
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,897
He's a touch melodramatic.

92
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:24,613
"What I'm about to tell
you is top secret.

93
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,734
"A conspiracy bigger than all of us.

94
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,745
"There's a powerful group
of people out there

95
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,474
"that are secretly running the world.

96
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,480
"I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

97
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,033

Hello?

00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:38,315
Hello.

113
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,901
Hey, Douglas Gitelman, WFO.

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,902
Lorin Connor, FBI New York.

115
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:47,237
Hi, guys, Michael
Kirkpatrick, New York.

116
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:48,858
Anyone else on?

117
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,313
Just waiting on you.

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,418
Hello, all. Everyone on?

119
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:55,342
It's Kirby, Megan, and Zach
from the seventh floor.

120
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,580
Yup, all here.

121
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,260
Great. Don't have a ton of time.

122
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,856
It is the nation's birthday, after all,

123
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,436
so let's get down to brass tacks.

124
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:08,352
E Corp, Google, AT&T, Uber,

125
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,514
Apple, Verizon, Facebook...

126
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:13,692
all 23 of these listed
companies have been complicit

127
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,834
in aiding the FBI in
Operation Berenstain.

128
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,544
Jesus, what is that noise?

129
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:27,293
Okay, tape's busted.

130
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,348
Just grab another one
and we'll do it again.

131
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:30,901
Yeah.

132
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,426
- Okay.
- F.... it.

133
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:45,040
I'll keep it simple.

134
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:48,873
Happy Fourth of July, fellow Americans.

135
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:51,857
On this patriotic holiday,
we wanted to remind you,

136
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:55,018
under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

137
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,059
Privacy is a Right.

138
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,641
Or at least it used to be.

139
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:01,212
Listen closely to a
classified conference call

140
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,427
we recently intercepted

141
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,064
between the FBI agents

142
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,826
that so earnestly promise you

143
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:09,452
fidelity, bravery, and integrity.

144
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:12,728
We've all been down this warrantless
wiretapping road, Doug.

145
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:15,068
If word were to get out about
Operation Berenstain...

146
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,084
Technically we're covered under
public safety of the Patriot Act.

147
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,293
Not to this scale.

148
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:22,362
Three million Americans under surveillance
for Five/Nine without a warrant?

149
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:23,805
Not to mention back door access

150
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:26,353
to every goddamn smart phone
out there. It's never going to...

151
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,035
Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million.

152
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,412
They got us the 17 we're
building our case around now.

153
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,124
Sixteen... in the code name case...

154
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:33,863
Right, sixteen, one's deceased.

155
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,008
Doesn't help that Comey
hasn't signed off on it.

156
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,444
The fact that we're keeping it from him

157
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,347
does not bode well for your case.

158
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:40,756
He's an uptight choirboy.

159
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,083
No one's gonna be crying over
how we catch these terrorists.

160
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,322
I guarantee that.

161
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:47,260
The FBI has 3 million
of you innocent citizens

162
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,447
under surveillance for no reason.

163
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:53,872
Their tyrannical rape of
our private data ends now.

164
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,041

00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,849
We will destroy you.

170
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,514
We are...

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,435
It's never going to be...

178
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,970
Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million...

179
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,382
Video's up.

180
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,474
16 in the code name case.

181
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,543
Right, 16. One's deceased.

182
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:45,111
It doesn't help that Comey
hasn't signed off on it.

183
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,347
Stop listening to that. It's
making you more paranoid.

184
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:51,766
What about this... code name case thing?

185
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:54,833
They said they have 16
suspects under surveillance.

186
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,086
Video's getting hits. It's
starting to get reposted.

187
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:00,035
They said one of the suspects

188
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:01,906
is dead.

189
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,335
They gotta be talking
about Romero, right?

190
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:08,128
We have to be on that list.

191
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,032
I uploaded the full Berenstain call

192
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:12,186
and transcript to WikiLeaks.

193
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,493
Oh!... Oh! Come on, slow your roll, bro.
No one's going anywhere.

194
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,491
We gotta monitor the
fallout of the video

195
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,837
before anyone makes a move.

196
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,123
Exposing their program
is gonna shut down the investigation.

197
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,622
I don't care anymore.

198
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm officially done.

199
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,713
You don't wanna do this.

200
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,598
You mean the... the Dark Army

201
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,311
doesn't want me to do this, bro?

202
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,889
No, no, no, no, I mean you.

203
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,519
'Cause when the Dark Army
finds out the FBI nails you,

204
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,003
which they will...

205
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,338
It's lights out.

206
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,503
No questions asked. You feel me?

207
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:44,305
Hey, stop.

208
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,739
You really think you
can force me to stay?

209
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,457
Without a doubt.

210
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,005
Guys!

211
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:04,478
JULY 4TH LIVE BAND
KARAOKE!

212
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,785
Happy Fourth of July,

213
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,314
fellow Americans.

214
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:16,875
On this patriotic holiday,

215
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,690
we wanted to remind you,

216
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,603
under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

217
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,601
- Privacy is a Right...
- Yo.

218
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:26,618
We're still on a date, remember?

219
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:29,234
Why is this video such
a big deal to you?

220
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,884
I'm gonna get another drink.

221
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,886
Hey, hey there, Ang.

222
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,420
Steve?

223
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,105
What are you doing here?

224
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,093
Oh, karaoke.
You know, gotta please the missus.

225
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:02,539
Missed you at your dad's barbecue today.

226
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,638
Yeah, I couldn't make it.

227
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,991
Right. Yeah, right.

228
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,772
You gotta be busy these days.

229
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,649
Congrats on everything.

230
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:13,031
Still, though, that's gotta be
tough on your father, though.

231
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,667
Having to watch while you bow down

232
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:17,393
to those bastards that
killed your mother.

233
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,634
That can't be an easy
pill for him to swallow.

234
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:25,209
For you, though, swallowing's
not really a problem,

235
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,714
now, is it?

236
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:32,063
Just... who the hell do
you think you are, anyway?

237
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,514
You're a plumber.

238
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,743
Right, Steve?

239
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,738
You've had, what,

240
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,200
60 years at life?

241
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:10,076
That's the best you can come up with?

242
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,959
Literally cleaning shit for a living?

243
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:18,989
I'm 27,

244
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,491
and I've got a six-figure salary

245
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,884
at the biggest conglomerate in history,

246
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,921
and I'm just getting started.

247
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,084
That's who I am.

248
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,761
Don't do this!

249
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,124
Now you're only at class B

250
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,551
felony kidnapping charges.

251
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,003
Don't bump it up to class A.

252
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,838
Shut the f... up!

253
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:00,285
You have no idea the shit you're in.

254
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,390
One of us should have
been watching the GPS.

255
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,243
This is some next-level shit, man.

256
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,433
Okay, we didn't have a choice.

257
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,868
We couldn't let her go to the cops.

258
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,569
Yeah, well, she can ID all of us now.

259
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,338
She saw everything, our whole setup.

260
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,380
- She knows who we are.
- Help!

261
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,682
Hello? I know you can see me!

262
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:24,422
God damn it. Trenton, go shut her up.

263
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,336
Go!

264
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,286
F... it.

265
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,322
I say we take our chances out there.

266
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:34,936
Let her go. Take off.

267
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,425
- Go our separate ways.
- Yeah, right.

268
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:37,893
Then there'll be a manhunt
with our faces on it.

269
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:39,295
Yeah, if there isn't one already.

270
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,770
Hello!

271
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,021
I need the bathroom.

272
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,932
Not yet.

273
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,915
I kinda can't control it.

274
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:54,985
Let me check downstairs first.

275
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,775
I really need to go.

276
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,546
It'll only take a second.

277
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,654
You guys don't know what
the hell you're doing,

278
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,092
do you?

279
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,349
You're Muslim?

280
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:20,029
Is that what all this is about?

281
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:22,394
ISIS or something?

282
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,507
You're all a bunch of goddamn animals.

283
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,056
Make it quick.

284
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,737
We were all there. You heard the call.

285
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:34,976
They have a secret
surveillance program on us.

286
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,716
Jesus, you're a broken record.

287
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,081
Man, you wanna live in denial?!

288
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,945
Go ahead, okay? Go right ahead.

289
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:44,798
All of you can't accept the
fact that maybe we f...d up.

290
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:46,133
Okay? Take a look at the city.

291
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:47,471
It's going to shit, man.

292
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,207
Now, first it'll be blackouts.

293
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,271
Then it'll be the National Guard.

294
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:51,638
- Either we go now or...
- Jesus!

295
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,933
Keep it together!

296
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,521
Darlene.

297
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,477
This isn't exactly what
I meant by "shut her up."

298
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,453
Okay, well...

299
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,931
maybe our problem solved itself.

300
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,658
Oh, so, what, we just let her die?

301
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,339
We need to get her to a hospital.

302
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:19,856
No.

303
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,944
No, not until we're sure she won't talk.

304
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:25,576
Tie her up.

305
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,112
That's a nasty head wound.

306
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,036
Okay, well, then we
don't have much time.

307
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,787
To do what?

308
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,427

NYU CARDIOLOGY: LIVING WITH A PACEMAKER

335
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,991
Did you check for any hidden partitions?

336
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,234
- Obviously.

341
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:12,410
She's a lawyer. She's gotta have dirt.

342
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,443
AMAZON CHECKOUT, AMAZON
BOOKS, GOOGLE MAPS...

343
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,644
Wait, I see Yahoo Mail
in her web history.

344
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,479
Maybe we do a pass on her drive?

345
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:19,181
Try to recover any deleted files.

348
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:28,957
Maybe we could target
Yahoo's server logs

349
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:31,193
and cross-reference any
incoming connections from here.

350
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,162
Might lead to an account
name and password hash.

351
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,037
- I could use bash bug.
- Or what about this?

352
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,724
YAHOO USERNAME AND PASSWORD

353
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,242
What if we do find
something on her, huh?

354
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,918
What then?

355
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:00,615
Cazadores on the rocks, please.

356
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:04,878
I love that song.

357
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,607
You really have a desire
to rule the world?

358
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,494
Oh, my desires go way beyond that.

359
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,005
Pretty sure my
daughter's older than you.

360
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,285
What about your granddaughter?

361
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,815
No, no, she'll be ten tomorrow.

362
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,994
I'm taking her to the zoo, actually.

363
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,226
Thanks.

364
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,656
Well, better get back to my colleagues.

365
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,978
You could do that,

366
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,425
or you could stay here,

367
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:50,324
talk to me.

368
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,102
I had nothing to do with Five/Nine.

369
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,324
I'm in finance, for f...'s sake.

370
00:19:01,354 --> 00:19:03,135
You think I wanted to
implode the economy?

371
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:04,709
Come on...

372
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,746
No, I agree with Mr. Jones here.

373
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:11,091
I've been scratching
my head on this one,

374
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:12,941
but evidence is evidence,

375
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:16,236
and holiday or not, I had
to follow up on this.

376
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,197
Found this incriminating little guy

377
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,440
at a critical location tied
to the Five/Nine hack.

378
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,292
The shell's microstamp leads
right to your client's gun.

379
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:28,127
The gun that he had in the
city of New York illegally,

380
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,680
I might add.

381
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,613
Immunity is on the table

382
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,496
in exchange for a name.

383
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,068
That's all I care about.

384
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,634
Let's keep this friendly.

385
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,416
I need a doctor.

386
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:30,729
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

387
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,560
Nice place you got.

388
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,173
Comfy.

389
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:11,874
Is your place in Greenwich this cush?

390
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,608
I worked hard for what I have.

391
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,158
You know, I'm glad

392
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:27,913
you came home,

393
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,003
but my friends

394
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,687
are freaking out.

395
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:34,119
Came up with this neat little plan

396
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:36,256
to blackmail you for your silence.

397
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,917
Hacked your emails.

398
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:42,205
We got some good stuff too.

399
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:47,278
Nice little Petraeus email
scam you got going on there.

400
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,157
You shouldn't get hot and heavy

401
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,195
with your presiding judges, Suze.

402
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,647
I'm sure you're aware that's illegal,

403
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,630
but...

404
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,424
I know you don't care
about things like that.

405
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,807
You'd slime your way around it

406
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:05,415
and f... us over just
like you did my dad.

407
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,059
Who's dead, by the way.

408
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,829
But you...

409
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,943
You aged very well.

410
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,044
The first time I saw you, I was four.

411
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:34,795
Still remember it.

412
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,421
On the news

413
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,713
in the courtroom when
they cleared E Corp

414
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:44,904
of all the bullshit they
put my family through.

415
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,969
And you were in the back

416
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:57,618
behind a sea of suits,

417
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,164
and you laughed.

418
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,116
It was so quick, no one even noticed.

419
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,713
No one but me.

420
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:12,369
Four-year-old little me.

421
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:19,195
So...

422
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,885
I'm happy

423
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:22,772
I get to look you in the eye.

424
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,378
I have taken down your company,

425
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,039
taken over your home,

426
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,641
and now...

427
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,437
I have you.

428
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:40,027
Okay.

429
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,349
So you got me.

430
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,658
Where do we go from here?

431
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,316
I'm sure we can figure something out.

432
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,581
I already have.

433
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:50,576
She just...

434
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,720
flipped out.

435
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,330
I was just trying to scare her back.

436
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,973
It was just a stun gun.

437
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,305
No.

438
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,867
No, no, she...

439
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:07,574
No, she had a heart condition.

440
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:10,478
I mean, there were lots of emails

441
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,554
from her doctor.

442
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:13,812
You di...

443
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:16,283
you didn't see any of those?

444
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,404
No.

445
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,915
Just go.

446
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,227
You two don't need to be here.

447
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:38,357
We'll wipe down the house
and figure it out.

448

SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

457
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,411
You think she actually...

458
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,302
Has to be self-defense.

459
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:33,109
What's the plan?

460
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:37,524
We can't stay here.

461
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,311
Who knows who's gonna be
waiting for you at home?

462
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:42,714
Dark Army, FBI, cops.

463
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,461
I can't leave my family.

464
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:48,309
If you had that much to lose,

465
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,280
you shouldn't have done
this in the first place.

466
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,559
But I did this for them.

467
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:57,079
What we did was
colossally fu...g stupid,

468
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,782
and we can't afford not
to realize that anymore.

469
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,213
Peace, Trent.

470
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:12,427
Yeah, I'm on my way.

471
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,921
All right, my vote,

472
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:29,971
we leave it here,

473
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:33,362
wipe our prints, and
just make a run for it.

474
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,886
We can't.

475
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:38,099
The others'll be back soon.
They'll find her.

476
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:41,954
Why don't I just... just text them

477
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,373
and tell them the place is burned?

478
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:46,541
Can't take the risk they won't listen

479
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,112
and come back anyway.

480
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,216
We need to get rid of it.

481
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,553
We ain't doing shit.

482
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,555
I'll see if my guys can take care of it.

483
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,156
Okay, no offense, but I
don't trust them either.

484
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:09,492
This is my responsibility.

485
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,991
Well, if this is the
part of the conversation

486
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,898
where you start throwing out ideas

487
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,622
like acid and wood chippers,

488
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:19,226
I ain't obliging.

489
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,656
This isn't a conversation.

490
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:25,690
We need to do what we
always do when we go

491
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,008
into full wipe-down mode after a hack.

492
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:04,898
Hurry up.

493
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,575
You know you screwed me last time?

494
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,136
You let all the dogs go.

495
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,607
I almost got fired.

496
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:19,984
What was that all about anyway?

497
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,808
Not like it matters. They
all ended up back here.

498
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,261
So as a matter of policy,

499
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:26,101
it's gonna cost you double this time.

500
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:27,616
Double?

501
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,293
Wait, we don't have double, man.

502
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:31,747
We... we barely pull out cash.

503
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:33,240
What about Ecoin?

504
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,505
It's worth more than cash anyway.

505
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:38,349
Pull out your phone.

506
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,203
What the f... is in there?

507
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,265
I'm paying you enough for privacy.

508
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,544
PAY TO...
AMOUNT TO PAY: E 2000.00

509
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:55,525
ECOIN: PAYMENT SENT

510
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:57,275
It's done.

511
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,742
All yours.

512
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:11,016
Susan donated them
from her cold storage.

513
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,513
It's not as if she can use them anymore.

514
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,413
She can pay for her own funeral.

515
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,433
No...

516
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,260
Oh, no, easy, easy, wait.

517
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,103
Just move it...

518
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,408
God.

519
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,331
Rug's too big.

520
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,780
No shit.

521
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,522
We need to take her out.

522
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,434
This is some traumatizing
shit. You know that?

523
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,236
Hey.

524
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,228
Come to my place tonight.

525
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:21,011
Come on, let's get some sleep.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

526
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,182
I didn't know I could do that.

527
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,293
You did what you had to do.

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,895
No, that's the thing.

529
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:37,668
I don't feel bad.

530
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:41,257
I always knew there was a part of me

531
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:44,491
that wanted to do this to her
for what she did, but...

532
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:48,187
I figured when that time came,

533
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:51,073
something would stop me...

534
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:54,779
But it didn't.

535
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,335
Hey, come on. Look,
you're just in shock.

536
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:07,997
All right? Look, come on.

537
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,591
Just... let's get some sleep.

538
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,112
Okay?

539
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,453
Okay.

540
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,929
I did what you say for me.

541
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,342
Okay, I used key under mat.
I put pizza inside.

542
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:33,646
No one inside. No one.

543
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,370
You didn't see anything weird or...

544
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,779
No, no one inside.

545
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,287
No one inside.

546
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,561
Okay, fine.

547
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:45,851
That's $20.

548
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:48,880
Wait.

549
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:53,019
Ca... can I... can I
have the other pizza?

550
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,627
It's another delivery, man.

551
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,248
It's another delivery.

552
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,452
Look, give me the other pizza.
I'm f... g nervous, man.

553
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:07,969
Have you guys ever
thought about moving?

554
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:10,220
What's this?

555
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,680
Maybe we should move
somewhere cheaper.

556
00:34:15,968 --> 00:34:18,246
I don't think the
city is safe anymore,

557
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:20,000
not with everything going on.

558
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,836
Don't be silly. Moving
is impossible right now.

559
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:24,461
The bank is fighting us on the deed.

560
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,711
It's a mess. They're not
letting anyone sell.

561
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,305
In fact, we may be at a bigger risk

562
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,779
of losing the money we
did invest in this home.

563
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:33,368
But we can find another place.

564
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,237
Dinner's almost ready.

565
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,198
I'll check outside.

566
00:35:27,484 --> 00:35:29,314
Sir, open up. FBI.

567
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,094
Sir, if you don't open the door,

568
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,932
we're gonna break it down.

569
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,194
Mr. Markesh, we didn't

570
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:55,215
mean for you to be
waiting here this long,

571
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:56,973
but with all the
bureaucracy and red tape,

572
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:58,572
it's getting a little
bonkers around here.

573
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:00,123
Yeah, well, I've been
waiting here all night.

574
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:02,628
What the f... is going on?

575
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:04,178
I feel your pain.

576
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,321
I've been stuck here all night too.

577
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,048
It's depressing, isn't it?

578
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,994
Here's what we're gonna do.

579
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,766
We're gonna talk, and all
you have to do is listen.

580
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,851
Because, believe it or not, Mr. Markesh,

581
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,297
you could be real instrumental

582
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:26,325
in helping to solve this Five/Nine case.

583
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,995
Leslie Romero.

584
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:42,456
Forgive me, hon, you do know
your friend was found murdered?

585
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:51,349
My heart goes out to you.
It's very unfortunate.

586
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,300
I went over to his mother's
after everything went down.

587
00:36:56,596 --> 00:36:58,031
I wanted to offer my condolences,

588
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:01,786
and I took a quick look around
while I was over there.

589
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,995
That's when I found this.

590
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:07,265
An end of the world party
featuring DJ Mobley.

591
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:09,958
I'm not an EDM fan myself,

592
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:12,405
but a quick search on
the wayback machine,

593
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:15,243
and guess what we found
all the way from 2003.

594
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,376
You.

595
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,606
An Angelfire page that you created

596
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:20,726
from back in the day.

597
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:23,788
Your very own DJ Mobley fan page.

598
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,735
In fact, curiously enough,

599
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:29,441
you were the only one that ever
created a fan page of this guy.

600
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,849
Must have really spoken to you.

601
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:34,205
Trust me, I feel the same way

602
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,415
about "Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion."

603
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,206
But like you, I found myself
very much in the minority.

604
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:49,042
So a big fan.

605
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:51,800
Obscure DJ with a unique name.

606
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,804
Seems like the perfect recipe

607
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,028
for how a hacker handle gets born.

608
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:01,916
Here's the deal:

609
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,152
we want Tyrell Wellick,

610
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,789
not Tyrell Wellick's DJ.

611
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,130
Your friend is dead, and
that's a sad thing,

612
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,606
but at this point, the best
thing that could happen

613
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:13,863
would be if there's
something you can tell me...

614
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:17,334
names, people,

615
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,702
any information at all

616
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,956
that you can give us from
that party that would help.

617
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:39,652
Lawyer.

618
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,425
I want a lawyer.

619
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:49,438
Did you have any evidence on this guy?

620
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,769
This is not the strategy
we have implemented.

621
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,072
Top down, not bottom up.

622
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,821
We needed to get some traction.

623
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,621
This is a way.

624
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,768
He's a minor player that
won't blow our strategy.

625
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,236
He'll start flushing
some of these guys out.

626
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:03,081
Are you not watching the news?

627
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,331
We are in a world of shit

628
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,544
because of this leaked conference call.

629
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:11,180
The OPR is going to be
coming down on us any day.

630
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:13,431
It's all over the Senate
Intelligence Hearings.

631
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:14,627
The deputy director,

632
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:16,236
assistant director of Cyber Division

633
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,849
and the EAD are all getting fired.

634
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,496
Comey's about to announce that
Operation Berenstain is dead,

635
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,363
and you just held this guy for 12 hours

636
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,002
for no reason.

637
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,530
You have to think about
how this looks, Dom.

638
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:40,828
Whatever paranoia you've
put into him is done,

639
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,817
just by picking him up.

640
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,899
Let him go.

641
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:00,341
NEW CONVERSATION

642
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:03,233
TO TRENTON

643
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:07,282
DESTRUCTS IN 5 SECONDS

644
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:21,091
WIPE DATA/FACTORY RESET

645
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:21,633
YES. DELETE ALL USER DATA.

646
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:22,937
WIPING DATA

647
00:40:34,272 --> 00:40:36,981
WICKR MESSENGER:
YOU HAVE 1 NEW MESSAGE

648
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:39,532
MESSAGE FROM DJMOBLEY

649
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:47,108
WE'RE BURNT. MUST LEAVE ASAP.
MEET ME AT THE PLACE WE FIRST MET. 12PM.

650
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:08,806
I'll be back later.

651
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,490
I lost her.

652
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,057
I don't know what I did wrong.

653
00:41:52,087 --> 00:41:53,144
I thought she was into me.

654
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:54,555
Don't let it get you in the dumps.

655
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:56,330
Getting into the mind of a woman,

656
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,013
it's the toughest route for
even the best sources.

657
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,138
I can't get into it right now.

658
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:03,428
This fsociety video's
blowing up in our face.

659
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,672
That's some f... d-up
shit you guys did.

660
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:07,165
It's got me all paranoid.

661
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,170
How do I know you guys
aren't watching me too?

662
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,576
We look like fools. Shit's
worse than Snowden.

663
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:13,957
<i>Privacy rights
activist Edward Snowden.</i>

664
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,726
<i>When you say I don't care</i>

665
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,161
- <i>about the right to privacy...
</i>- Speak of the devil.

666
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:18,329
<i>Because I have nothing to hide,</i>

667
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,997
<i>that's no different than saying</i>

668
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,231
<i>I don't care about freedom of speech</i>

669
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,737
<i>because I have nothing to say.</i>

670
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,835
<i>Despite the cybersecurity breach</i>

671
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:25,959
<i>in obtaining the information</i>

672
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:27,300
<i>on Operation Berenstain,</i>

673
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,673
<i>the controversy over Privacy Rights</i>

674
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:31,609
<i>has prompted calls for greater
government transparency.</i>

675
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,518
- <i>Advocates are demanding..</i>.
- Look, I'm done with this.

676
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,969
You know, she's stone cold anyway, Dom.

677
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:40,265
I'm not gonna lie...

678
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,567
I kinda got hurt.

679
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,644
She never talked about fsociety

680
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,884
or her old friends from back in the day?

681
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:49,742
She hasn't given up anything
since you first put me on her,

682
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:52,340
and she bailed on me for
some old dude at the bar.

683
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,033
A contact?

684
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:56,767
I think she's just into old dudes.

685
00:42:56,797 --> 00:43:00,003
<i>Paying employees only a
portion of their wages.</i>

686
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:04,415
<i>In a statement, UWUA leaders claimed...</i>

687
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:21,140
REGULATORS! LET'S DANCE

688
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,877
Cisco?

689
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,837
Cisco?

690
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:37,669
Yo, what's up?

691
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:53,585
What's up?

692
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,702
PASSWORD

693
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:04,881
How long you been up?

694
00:44:05,357 --> 00:44:07,104
I just got up.

695
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:10,090
I jumped straight in the shower.
I'll be out in a sec, though.

696
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:11,865
You all right?

697
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:20,767
Yeah, fine.

698
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,425
NEW CONVERSATION
TO: DJMOBLEY

699
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:48,948
I'M HERE. WHERE R U?
BEEN WAITING 2 HOURS.

700
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,733
DESTRUCTS IN 5 SECONDS

701
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:10,491
Cisco: I have her, she's with me.

702
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:16,104
Good job with the femtocell,
the backdoor is in play...

703
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:19,635
...Stage 2 is about to begin.

704
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:37,288
You all right?

705
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,571
Yo, what the f.. ?
