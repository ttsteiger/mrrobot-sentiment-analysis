You do that, I can guarantee we
don't walk out of here alive.

170
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:58,006
On my first date with Tyrell,

171
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,375
I saw this stunning redhead

172
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,180
wearing a pair of cubic
zirconia earrings.

173
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:09,484
I asked him what he would do
to get me those earrings.

174
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,889
He told me he would do
whatever was necessary.

175
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:17,926
I told him I wanted him
to fuck that woman

176
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:20,062
and bring me her earrings.

177
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,701
The next morning,

178
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,703
I woke up to a gift.

179
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:35,110
These are the cheapest things I own,

180
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,613
yet they're my favorite.

181
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,783
Tyrell would always do
what was necessary.

182
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,685
And at the end of that,

183
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,587
I would receive a gift.

184
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:49,391
That's why I know he's alive.

185
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,560
That's why he's been calling me...

186
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,799
That's why he sent me this phone...

187
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:05,741
Because he's doing what's necessary.

188

189

197

That's what you do for your partner.

198
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,509
The calls come up as unknown.

199
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,978
I've tried to have him
tracked, but I've been...

200
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,647

201
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,316

be able to accomplish?

who strangled that woman...
