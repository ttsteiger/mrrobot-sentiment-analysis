1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,152
How do I take off a mask
when it stops being a mask,

2
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:05,608
when it's as much a part of me as I am?

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:06,766
- 10:00 a.m.
- Amen.

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:07,900
12:00 p.m.

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,201
Life, love...

6
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:10,703
- 2:00 p.m.
- I'm Ray.

7
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:13,673
To stay as sane as
possible until he's gone.

8
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,775
I am not to be gotten rid of!

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,411
I find you refreshing... young, bold...

10
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:20,179
exactly what we need right now.

11
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:23,382
The FBI believes that I
was behind the hack.

12
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:24,750
Gideon's gonna rat you out.

13
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,287
Something ain't right about this guy.

14
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:29,388
Bang!

15
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:30,389
I don't trust him.

16
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:34,293
We are in a war, and they are
picking us off one by one.

17
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:38,931
Tyrell Wellick and fsociety
engaged in this attack.

18
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,235
Bonsoir, Elliott.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,757
All right, man, explain
this to me again.

20
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,626
Why are you taking me to an arcade?

21
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,162
Well, I'm trying to tell
you, but you don't listen.

22
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:11,964
That's the problem with
your generation...

23
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,266
too ADD to really take in this world.

24
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:16,168
All right, all right,
break it down for me.

25
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,603
Well, to really get it,

26
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:20,439
I got to take you back to 1924.

27
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,775
Husband-and-wife team, the Bedfords,

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,277
opened up a freak show/ dwarf sanctuary

29
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:26,612
on this land you're about to be at.

30
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,080
Dwarf sanctuary?

31
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:30,249
Yeah, they called it the
Bedford Lilliputian...

32
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:31,617
a whole miniature city

33
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:33,819
scaled down for dwarf
and midget inhabitants.

34
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,354
I mean, they also had other freaks

35
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:39,024
like lion-faced man, limbless
woman, shit like that.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,827
But the dwarves were the big moneymaker.

37
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:43,963
Suffice to say, the
Bedfords were a big hit...

38
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:45,531
lines around the corner,

39
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,701
the biggest attraction out
here in Coney Island.

40
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,002
Then one year, rumor has it,

41
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:52,471
the husband wakes up
one Christmas morning,

42
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:56,175
grabs a large kitchen knife,
slices his wife's throat open,

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,812
stabs his little kids to death,
then slits his own wrists.

44
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:02,615
- Huh.
- No motive was ever determined.

45
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,682
God.

46
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,885
Cut to the 1960s.

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,555
Woman named Mary Meghan Fisher
decided to buy up the place,

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,291
turned it into an old-school arcade...

49
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:13,959
pinball machines, Skee-Ball, the likes.

50
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,861
Called it "Games Games Games."

51
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:20,132
Shit, a bit on the nose, if you ask
me, not to mention repetitive,

52
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:22,067
but at least it had clarity.

53
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:25,337
Mary Meghan even installed a little bar
so she could get drunk with her friends

54
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,173
and shoot pool at night.

55
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:31,076
And so she did, almost every night...

56
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:34,013
till one time in '86,
she got so liquored up,

57
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,182
she accidentally fell off the barstool

58
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,384
and landed hard on the
pool cue she was holding.

59
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,685
Oh.

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,353
Went right through her neck, clean.

61
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,055
Killed her right on the spot.

62
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,157
What in the f... are you
telling me this for, man?

63
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:54,400
Place remained dormant until 2000,

64
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,436
when Ned Bosham bought up
the joint under the name

65
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:01,006
Fun Society Amusement LLC.

66
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,175
Ned wanted to reopen it
as a classic arcade.

67
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:06,445
Now, why anyone would want
to start an arcade in 2000

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,348
beats me, but Ned Bosham
had it in his mind

69
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,084
that that's what he wanted
to do, and so he did.

70
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,758
About a year ago, his oldest
son, Harold, wanted to sell it,

71
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,528
but Ned wasn't down with that.

72
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:25,431
So the oldest son, Harold, being
simpleminded and needing money

73
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,433
for whatever simpleminded
folks need money for,

74
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,602
decided Dad had to go.

75
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:33,138
So Harold stole his twin
brother's hunting rifle

76
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,474
and shot Dad in the face.

77
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,177
Now, what Harold wasn't counting on,

78
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:40,079
considering he had never
fired a weapon before,

79
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:41,413
was the kickback.

80
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,449
It kicked back so hard,
he tripped and fell

81
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,650
out of his dad's 20-story window.

82
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:47,753
By the time he hit the
ground, his head opened up

83
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,321
like one of those Gallagher watermelons.

84
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:53,125
All this commotion stirred
awake his twin brother, Clyde,

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
who, as he told it to
me, was in his bedroom

86
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:57,396
catching some Zs when
all this went down.

87
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,931
By the time he got his bearings,

88
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,166
he was immediately arrested
for the double homicide

89
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,401
of his brother and father,

90
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:05,104
being the weapon was in his name.

91
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,972
And how do you know Clyde?

92
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,274
He was my cellmate.

93
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:12,811
This place made him crazy.

94
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,246
He thinks it's cursed.

95
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,682
Yeah. No shit, Sherlock.

96
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:19,118
Before I left the clink, he
gave me the keys to the joint

97
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:20,920
and made me swear to burn it down

98
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,655
before it caused any more ruckus.

99
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,323
He swears it's haunted...

100
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:27,860
believes it is the nexus of
all evil in the universe.

101
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,798
You buy into any of this shit?

102
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,033
F... no, man.

103
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,136
I'm too broke to be superstitious.

104
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:40,606
In a way, all this hocus-pocus
keeps things clean

105
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,608
for whatever it is you need to do.

106
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,276
The public records are in limbo.

107
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,845
People down in county don't
even want to touch the place.

108
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,014
I'm siphoning electricity from the grid.

109
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,183
As far as anyone's
concerned, it don't exist.

110
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,885
Now, on the market, this
joint would run you

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,820
about 5 grand a month,
but since it's you,

112
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:58,223
I'll give it to your guy for half.

113
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,125
Come on, Mobley, don't
give me that look, man.

114
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:03,062
You know how hard it is for
an ex-con to get a job.

115
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,130
Money's tight,

116
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,832
especially with my mom's cataracts.

117
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,334
The bills are adding up.

118
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm not here to rent from you, Romero.

119
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,642
I want you to work with us.

120
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,677
Oh, hell no, man. I just got out.

121
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,813
I ain't trying to go back no time soon.

122
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,247
Just hear my guy out, okay?

123
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:23,849
We need a phreaker.

124
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,484
Now, you know you're
the best in the game.

125
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,219
Don't try to sweet-talk
me, motherf... er.

126
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,254
I don't need you to tell me
who's the best in the game.

127
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,256
I invented the shit, okay?

128
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,660
Now, either you're renting,
or I'm finding somebody else,

129
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:37,329
but I cannot get mixed up in
whatever it is you're doing.

130
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:40,032
Man, this is a chance to
get back at the system

131
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:43,469
that stole six years of your life.

132
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,674
This is a game changer, man.

133
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,777
Who's this guy, again?

134
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,079
He's, uh... he's a little weird.

135
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:56,949
But, uh, he's gonna love this place.

136
00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:59,785
He's got a thing for Coney Island.

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,554
You'll like him.

138
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,123
Actually, you'll hate him.

139
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,725
But he's a genius.

140
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:08,761
Best coder I've ever met.

141
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:10,295
And he wants to meet you.

142
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,700
How much?

143
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:17,403
Aw, don't smile. I ain't said yes yet.

144
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,738
Money's gonna be the
deciding factor in all this,

145
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:23,442
and it's gonna need to be a
whole lot to bring me back in.

146
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:26,111
That's the thing, man.

147
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:27,246
In a way,

148
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,982
this pays everything.

149
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,323
What happened to the U and the N?

150
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,159
Oh, that?

151
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,827
That's a story for another time.

152
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,471
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

153
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:49,161
Panic. Here it comes again.

154
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,796
Remember?

155
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,532
That sudden sensation of fear,

156
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,702
overwhelming fear,

157
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,571
burrowing its way underneath my brain,

158
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:01,573
making itself at home...

159
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:04,843
Nesting...

160
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,818
Screaming in my mind.

161
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,738
It's good to hear your voice.

162
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,611
Where are you?

163
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:44,583
Not yet where I'm supposed to be.

164
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,451
But soon, very soon.

165
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:49,021
Protestors are taking to the
street in massive numbers,

166
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:50,622
and police and community leaders

167
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,925
are at a loss as to what
to do at this point,

168
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,959
citing that...

169
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,894
And where is that?

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,967
I don't think that's a good idea.

171
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:06,071
You think someone's listening?

172
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,476
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

173
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:17,082
You don't want me to
have to worry about you.

174
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,084
I need to know what's going on.

175
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,652
It's not safe.

176
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,721
I wish it were.

177
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:24,223
Oh, how I wish.

178
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,425
How I wish.

179
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,894
I think about you a lot, Elliot.

180
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,096
I think about that night

181
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,931
when we became gods.

182
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,567
That night...

183
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:37,269
I want to know what happened.

184
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:43,308
Tell me what happened.

185
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,981
Like he said, it's not safe,

186
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:51,483
not on the phone.

187
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,151
I'm not gonna let you make me a prisoner

188
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,686
of my own paranoia again.

189
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,154
If you're not paranoid,

190
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,423
you need me more than you think you do.

191
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,658
We had a deal.

192
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:00,859
You wanted to talk to him.

193
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:02,427
I delivered.

194
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:03,929
It's not my fault he's loony tunes.

195
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:06,164
He really expects me to believe this?

196
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,867
Did we really talk to the most
wanted man on the planet?

197
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,469
Why the f... are you asking them?

198
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:11,870
You heard him. You talked to him.

199
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,772
I talk to you too.

200
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,807
What do you want, huh?

201
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:17,476
We had a deal. I delivered!

202
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:20,012
What more do you want?

203
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,047
What I've always wanted:

204
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,448
for the panic to finally stop.

205
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,384
Shocking news from last night,

206
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:28,987
Gideon Goddard, owner and CEO
of Allsafe Cybersecurity,

207
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,290
considered ground zero for
the Five/Nine attacks,

208
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,692
was shot dead at a bar in Manhattan.

209
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:36,361
The suspected murderer
surrendered at the scene.

210
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:37,796
The alleged gunman,

211
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,897
whose name has yet to be released...

212
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,465
But it won't.

213
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:41,833
Described by law enforcement sources

214
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,402
as disgruntled, unemployed,

215
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:45,470
and having a history of mental illness.

216
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:48,373
Just don't know why you
can't send me a new one.

217
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,810
You ain't even with E Corp.

218
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:53,312
Well, I guess I never figured

219
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:56,048
you were all in bed together like that.

220
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,983
How am I supposed to pay the bills

221
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:00,686
if my autopay stopped working?

222
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,655
Okay, somebody's at the door.

223
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,024
Guess I got to call you back.

224
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,893
Uh-huh, like you give a shit.

225
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,328
Door's open.

226
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,530
Come on in.

227
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:12,831
Hi, Mrs. Romero.

228
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,166
Oh.

229
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,734
I don't know where he at.

230
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,235
Ain't seen him for a bit.

231
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,837
Probably downstairs.

232
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:20,105
You know how he is.

233
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,574
Just comes and goes, goes and comes.

234
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,383
Rome!

235
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:32,718
Yo, Rome!

236
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,653
Where you at, man?

237
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,256
Rome?

238
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,025
Whoa.

239
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,260
What the f... is that smell, man?

240
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,568
Rome?

241
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,162
Rome?

242
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,374
Shit.

243
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,174
But has become a citywide
epidemic for families as well.

244
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,676
Now let's check in with Jessie

245
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,578
for our five borough weather report.

246
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,880
Oh, thank you, Chris. I
wish I could tell you...

247
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,415
Got those at Mel's.

248
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,750
Beautiful, huh?

249
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,819
Sad to see his shop shut down.

250
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,521
Mm.

251
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:54,824
Mmm.

252
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Was gonna leave it to his nephew too.

253
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:58,194
Kid with the burnt face.

254
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,362
You know what I'm talking about?

255
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,763
What's his name?

256
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,267
Mm.

257
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,269
Can't think of it.

258
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,872
Anyway, with everything
going on with the trucking,

259
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,608
Mel says fresh deliveries
just aren't coming through.

260
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:14,911
'Sides, now that the allowance

261
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,079
is down to just $50 a day,

262
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:18,081
no one's spending it on flowers.

263
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,286
Hmm.

264
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:28,525
I swear, the only way I'm
getting through this

265
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,493
is having breakfast with you.

266
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,732
Mets won again.

267
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:39,302
It's gonna be their year.

268
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:40,570
Yeah, I know.

269
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:43,573
I know, I know, I know, I know.

270
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:44,974
Ready, y'all?

271
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,579
Pick up.

272
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,214
Ah, damn. Come on.

273
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,616
Can't never do it with that shit!

274
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,890
Take it easy with that dosage, cuz.

275
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,458
I ain't your keeper, and I damn straight

276
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,961
ain't gonna be your
reaper neither, you dig?

277
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,896
- Let's go!
- Come on!

278
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:10,233
What problem you trying
to solve anyway, man?

279
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,202
How do I tell him that
someone I cared about died?

280
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,508
I'm fine.

281
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:22,278
You know, that's what
you always saying, man.

282
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,213
So we're back to the morphine?

283
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,284
Don't listen, man.

284
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,453
What do you think that's going
to accomplish, exactly?

285
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:31,821
It's not morphine.

286
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,790
It's Adderall.

287
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,593
This is your fault.

288
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:40,496
All of it.

289
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,332
Now it's time to get rid of you.

290
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,228
When a computer gets hit
with a kernel panic,

291
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:14,464
there's only so much you can do.

292
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:15,732
An internal fatal error

293
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,800
is hard to recover from.

294
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,302
I mean, listen to that:

295
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,237
internal fatal error.

296
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:24,574
Sounds pretty fucking bad, you ask me.

297
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,676
But OD'ing on Adderall
was finally my way

298
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,544
of controlling him.

299
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,855
Do you have a moment, Mr. Alderson?

300
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,657
Is this the FBI?

301
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,326
Did Gideon rat me out?

302
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,861
Come on!

303
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:46,195
Help!

304
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:47,330
Help!

305
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:50,066
No! No!

306
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:12,622
_

307
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:21,597
This is a New Lots
Avenue-bound four train.

308
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:46,823
This is a Brooklyn-bound
two express train.

309
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,759
Next stop is DeKalb Avenue.

310
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:56,566
Stand clear of the
closing doors, please.

311
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,107
Elliot and I both warned you

312
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:05,475
it was a liability he sold drugs.

313
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,178
God damn it.

314
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:11,614
Why are you being such an asshole?

315
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:13,483
He's dead.

316
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,190
Did anyone see you?

317
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,794
Just his mom.

318
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,432
What did you want me to do?

319
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,234
She was upstairs.

320
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,711
F..., Darlene.

321
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:45,681
What did we do?

322
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,588
Where am I?

323
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,523
Where am I?

324
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:43,439
What are you doing?

325
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,243
What's that for?

326
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,580
What's that for?

327
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,088
No, no, wait.

328
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,192
No.

329
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:04,227
No!

330
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:07,296
No! I have them! No!

331
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,667
That's it.

332
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,135
Get that Adderall out of your system.

333
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,637
Good boy.

334
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,405
That's it, get those shitty pills

335
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
out of your system.

336
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:10,126
I have burrowed underneath your brain.

337
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,794
I am nested there.

338
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:14,764
I am the scream in your mind.

339
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,199
You will cooperate, my son.

340
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,268
I will make you, because I own you!

341
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,137
Argh!

342
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:00,977
I will not be owned.

343
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,330
First, I want to offer my condolences.

344
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,532
Terrible news about your old boss.

345
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,201
I hear he was a good man.

346
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,871
Very unfortunate when bad
things happen to good people.

347
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,741
Thank you, sir.

348
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,543
I've been pretty broken up about it.

349
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,246
Second, this interview
that you've set up,

350
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,881
it's all wrong.

351
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,017
I want to do Fox instead of Bloomberg.

352
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,920
No preinterview, and I
want final approval

353
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:42,457
of all questions beforehand.

354
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,894
I'm on it.

355
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,374
Mr. Price?

356
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,077
I think this is a mistake.

357
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,045
Frankly, Fox isn't where
we should be right now.

358
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:06,214
Bloomberg is where investors
get their business news,

359
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,549
and if our goal is to reassure them...

360
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:08,817
Sit down.

361
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:44,853
Have you ever had dinner at Fidelio's?

362
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,559
No.

363
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:52,093
I haven't.

364
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:54,229
Used to be a dive bar years ago.

365
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:56,298
It's since turned into one
of the nicest restaurants

366
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,600
in the city.

367
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:02,337
I know the chef.

368
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,205
He's very good.

369
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,412
I'll have Marcel make a reservation.

370
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,681
You've never had semifreddo

371
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,616
until you've had it there.

372
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,055
Okay.

373
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,263
I'll arrange a car to pick you up.

374
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:31,433
Saturday, 8:00.

375
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:35,170
And, uh, yes, you're right.

376
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,940
Bloomberg... it's more appropriate.

377
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:40,542
We'll stick with that.

378
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:48,316
Thank you, sir.

379
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,293
I've noticed you always look at that

380
00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:00,395
before you leave my office.

381
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,568
Perhaps you find it as
fascinating as I do...

382
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,808
How a man can change the whole world

383
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:17,512
with a bullet in the right place.

384
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,883
Oh, no, what does that say?

385
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,022
Don't fall over.

386
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,150
_

387
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:31,860
You okay? You okay?

388
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,595
_

389
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,397
I don't want to go to
sleep another night

390
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,666
not knowing you're not gonna be my wife.

391
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:43,238
Oh, my God.

392
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,911
Emilia, will you marry me?

393
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,617
Next on "Million Dollar
Listing New York"...

394
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:57,085
Am I gonna be dealing with you...

395
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,455
Alexa, what time is it?

396
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,058
It is 4:03 a.m.

397
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:04,426
That's it, not a penny more.

398
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,593
Whatever she says goes.

399
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:59,948
Alexa, stop.

400
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:21,563
Whew, sorry. Something's going around.

401
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,000
Victim's mother's back at the station.

402
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:25,435
Didn't get much from her.

403
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,936
Down here.

404
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:32,842
All we got on the victim so far is,

405
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,444
he's a known hacker with a record.

406
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,179
Got busted in '08.

407
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:39,149
Served six years for some
small-time computer fraud stuff.

408
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:43,419
It's okay. I got gloves on.

409
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:44,988
Well, it doesn't matter
much if you sneeze...

410
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,825
On them. Okay.

411
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,761
Tell you what, why don't
you hold this still?

412
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:54,831
We're still looking, but
it looks like he only

413
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:57,600
printed out these three sheets
from the full FBI roster.

414
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,939
We contacted everyone here
at the New York office.

415
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,641
You're the first to respond.

416
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,677
It doesn't mean much.

417
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:09,379
Thousands of FBI names
and contact details

418
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:10,613
were leaked a few months back.

419
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:11,915
Every hacker has this.

420
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,555
What are they doing?

421
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,722
Uh, it's Forensics.

422
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,391
We found his desktop unlocked.

423
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,159
Uh, once we're done analyzing it,

424
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,894
we'll send a full report.

425
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,130
Did you have them check if the
ports were modified at all

426
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:29,165
before using them?

427
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:31,367
- Whoa!
- Shit!

428
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:33,036
Fire extinguisher.

429
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:38,408
Well...

430
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,047
Here's my card in case
you find anything else.

431
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,848
Thanks again for calling me.

432
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:48,751
I'd really talk to your
doctor about getting a Z-Pak.

433
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:51,087
You really shouldn't be out
here infecting your whole unit.

434
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,855
It's very irresponsible of you.

435
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:11,808
_

436
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,879
_

437
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,528
According to the police report,

438
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,297
there was no sign of a robbery.

439
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:35,732
Someone was there

440
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,567
with the sole purpose of offing him.

441
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:40,903
You're jumping to conclusions.

442
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:42,272
What about that Allsafe guy?

443
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:44,140
That's two murders in a row

444
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,775
associated with this hack.

445
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,976
They caught the guy.

446
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:49,412
It was just some wack-job.

447
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:52,582
Besides, I don't really care
discussing this with you,

448
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,917
given how easily you forgot
about what we started.

449
00:28:54,953 --> 00:28:57,287
What, because I don't care
for stupid high jinks

450
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:59,722
like burning money in
the middle of a park?

451
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:01,557
That stupid high jinks

452
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:03,559
is killing public confidence in E Corp,

453
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:05,628
which is exactly what we
need to be doing right now.

454
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,664
We might be getting
executed by the Dark Army,

455
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:10,166
and this is what you'd
rather be discussing?

456
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:12,835
It's not the Dark Army.

457
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:14,404
They don't know Romero

458
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,738
or the two of you.

459
00:29:15,774 --> 00:29:17,340
They only communicate through me,

460
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,375
and I sure as shit didn't
tell them anything.

461
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:25,148
You're not the only
person they've talked to.

462
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,655
He wouldn't do that.

463
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,526
The state Elliot's in, we don't know...

464
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,930
Don't say what you're thinking.

465
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:42,465
You don't want to listen to reason,

466
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,933
that's on you.

467
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,368
But I'm taking off.

468
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,003
I'm not sticking around to be next.

469
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,339
I'm gonna stay with my buddy in Arizona.

470
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,942
If they wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

471
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:55,611
Besides, if you're just
gonna end up in Arizona,

472
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,680
then being dead isn't
that much of a downgrade.

473
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,148
Ha-ha.

474
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:01,317
Then what do you suggest we do, then?

475
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:05,621
I'll talk to Elliot.

476
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:07,490
I'll hit you both when I get more info.

477
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:09,625
Until then,

478
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:11,828
stop spazzing...

479
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,101
And be cool.

480
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:35,151
I don't trust her

481
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:38,154
or her crazy-ass brother.

482
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:40,590
You know he tried to
pull a gun on Romero?

483
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,761
Think about it, Trenton.

484
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,829
They're the only two that
talked to the Dark Army.

485
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:49,899
Now they're trying to tell us
the Dark Army isn't involved.

486
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:52,602
What are you saying?

487
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:56,839
I'm saying we just committed
the crime of the century,

488
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,508
and they're trying to
cover their tracks.

489
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:01,377
And right now, we're the tracks.

490
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:10,429
A lot of life is a balancing act.

491
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:14,701
We're all just doing our best,

492
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:18,505
tightrope walking above
that pit of ungodly pain

493
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,774
that's daring us to trip up.

494
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,745
Take money and health.

495
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,748
One isn't very useful without
the other, you know?

496
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:31,217
Case in point:

497
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:35,188
even though you've been paid handsomely,

498
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,890
the physical condition
you're in right now

499
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,892
kind of cancels that out.

500
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:42,796
And I'd like to say upfront...

501
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:46,733
I'm very sorry this happened to you.

502
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,636
The guys I deal with,
they can be ruthless.

503
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:53,773
Me, I'm more of a positive
reinforcement kind of guy.

504
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:57,243
You know, I just happen to
think it's more productive.

505
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:04,417
Nevertheless, that don't change
what's been done to you.

506
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,054
The person who did this

507
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,457
will get proportionate retribution.

508
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:16,329
On that tip, I still need you
to fix this thing for me.

509
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:21,835
Our site's been down way too long.

510
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,804
Good news is, once you bring it back up,

511
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,139
you will get your money,

512
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:29,576
and, in time, God willing,

513
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:32,178
your health.

514
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:36,249
That's all I want to do here...

515
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,718
help put your life back in balance.

516
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,659
They keep emptying the Bitcoin wallets,

517
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:49,829
and the server keeps crashing.

518
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:51,865
I don't know how to stop it.

519
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,301
I only know basic network
security measures.

520
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:57,804
You have to find someone who...

521
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,106
who can migrate the site to another,

522
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:03,143
more secure location

523
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:06,880
and set up a system of
hot and cold wallets.

524
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:08,548
Just...

525
00:33:10,385 --> 00:33:12,485
Please...

526
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,455
Please.

527
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,159
I can't... I can't figure it out.

528
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,221
I could try to convince him again.

529
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:50,490
Just because you beat a
man's face to a pulp

530
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:53,526
don't mean he gonna know what he don't.

531
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:56,229
We're not animals.

532
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,364
We need to find someone who
can do that migration thing

533
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,700
he keep talking about.

534
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:05,371
This heat wave is a motherf... er.

535
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,173
What's the high supposed to be today?

536
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:12,045
What you looking at me for?

537
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,581
Turn on the goddamn weather
station, let's go.

538
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:28,595
Can I tell you a secret?

539
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,265
It's been three days since I slept.

540
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,368
I'm up to about 200 milligrams now.

541
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:38,071
But that's not the secret.

542
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:39,772
He's gone.

543
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:41,608
You heard me.

544
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:44,310
He's gone.

545
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:54,053
It was so simple.

546
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,589
I'm way more aware now.

547
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,057
I'm way more focused.

548
00:34:58,093 --> 00:35:00,493
And I'm feeling 100%.

549
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,999
He's gone. He's gone.

550
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,167
He's gone.

551
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:09,836
The Adderall is working,

552
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:12,438
and f... if this drug doesn't feel good.

553
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:16,242
I can even handle talking with people.

554
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:18,011
Yo, bro, he's like...

555
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:19,779
Even Leon's stupid "Seinfeld" philosophy

556
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,948
is starting to sound fascinating.

557
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:23,783
So... so he just... he just...

558
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:24,851
he just ran out of the party,

559
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,319
pushing old people aside?

560
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:28,321
That's so funny. Was there even a fire?

561
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:30,757
I mean, that's classic
George, am I right?

562
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,859
I don't like this, bro.

563
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:39,666
Why haven't I done this before?

564
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,834
Damn, these dishes look immaculate.

565
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:49,008
I'm pretty sure I even found God.

566
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:50,977
Amen!

567
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:52,345
Amen!

568
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,547
Amen, Amen, Amen!

569
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,983
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen!

570
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:59,319
Amen! Amen!

571
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:01,387
Even the dumb basketball
game is enthralling.

572
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,323
The ball goes into a hoop.

573
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:04,357
Of course.

574
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,993
Whoo!

575
00:36:07,028 --> 00:36:09,162
Slam dunk!

576
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:11,564
We can finally be back to normal.

577
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,666
It'll just be me and you, my friend.

578
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,301
We'll dine together.

579
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,203
Maybe I'll read to you.

580
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:18,471
Or we'll just talk.

581
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:19,906
But the point is,

582
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,674
he's gone,

583
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,144
and now it's just us.

584
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,714
You're not buying any of this either.

585
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,015
Are you?

586
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:39,192
It was feeling good

587
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:41,194
for a few days.

588
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,895
It really was,

589
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,597
wasn't it?

590
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:47,934
But this is the fifth
day of not sleeping,

591
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:50,203
I think.

592
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,005
Fifth...

593
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,540
Isn't that a funny word?

594
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,542
Shit.

595
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:58,177
There it is again.

596
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,016
The overwhelming fear building,

597
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:04,884
the burrowing,

598
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,353
the nesting,

599
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:08,755
the scream.

600
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:11,958
Stoob Dnalamit Gniraew eb Egroeg.

604
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:20,967
I know, I know, Leon's
talking backwards.

605
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,368
This isn't good.

606
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,977
Yeah, I know.

607
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:32,612
That's very weird too.

608
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:43,790
My internal fatal error...

609
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:48,327
From which my system
cannot safely recover.

610
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,174
Kernel panic.

611
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:09,949
Day number six without sleep.

612
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,121
I'm crashing.

613
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:25,531
Next, my consciousness will go.

614
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,842
The panic isn't settling in anymore.

615
00:38:35,877 --> 00:38:38,511
It's just there.

616
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:41,380
The scream in my mind is coming back.

617
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,233
You are likable.

618
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,903
You are attractive.

619
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:08,808
You are beautiful.

620
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:14,514
Revolution!

621
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:16,182
Revolution!

622
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:18,151
- What is that solution?
- Revolution!

623
00:39:18,186 --> 00:39:20,319
Phillip Price, please.

624
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,587
Your party's here.

625
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:23,189
Do you want me to show you to the table?

626
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:03,462
Angela.

627
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,765
Yes, come. Please, please.

628
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,067
I'd like you to meet two
of your colleagues.

629
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,738
Gentlemen, introduce yourselves.

630
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:13,873
Saul Weinberg,

631
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:15,575
managing director of operations.

632
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,443
Hi. Angela. It's nice to meet you.

633
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:20,580
Jim Chutney, SVP of B.A.

634
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:24,083
Angela.

635
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:27,286
Phillip Price, master of the universe.

636
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:36,896
All right.

637
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,303
Yes.

638
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,007
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

639
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,343
Because of the situation,

640
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,011
you have to pay upfront now.

641
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:56,849
Well, a toast.

642
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:58,451
May new relationships

643
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:01,887
lead to new opportunities.

644
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:10,487
_

645
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,807
_

646
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:25,706
Oh, God.

647
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:38,186
Alexa, when is the end of the world?

648
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,323
Unless it collides
with a very large rock

649
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,226
or a future technology
goes very wrong indeed,

650
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:46,995
Earth is most likely to be destroyed

651
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,830
when the sun swells into a red giant

652
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:50,899
in several billion years' time.

653
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:56,838
Right.

654
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:55,129
I know you... you want
me to talk about myself,

655
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:56,931
but I don't...

656
00:42:56,967 --> 00:43:00,802
The Adderall's almost out of my system.

657
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,305
With that, sleep will return.

658
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:06,574
Any second now, he's gonna come back,

659
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,244
and my mind will be under siege again.

660
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,712
This isn't something, like, I-I...

661
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:13,214
Mr. Robot has become my god,

662
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,883
and like all gods,

663
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:16,584
their madness takes you prisoner.

664
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,653
There was this...

665
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:21,322
I guess I couldn't avoid
Gideon's death after all.

666
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,259
My dam of guilt is finally cracking.

667
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:27,662
I want to cry, but I'm
so high that I can't.

668
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:30,965
There was an Indian man
working behind the counter,

669
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:35,637
and I made fun of his accent.

670
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:38,006
And talk like this.

671
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,909
"Hello, how you doing?"

672
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:43,678
And one day, he stood up for himself.

673
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:46,514
"Sir, I must ask you to leave."

674
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:52,654
And something snapped in me,

675
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:55,323
and I just popped him in the face.

676
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:56,991
I saw red, man.

677
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:59,627
I just... I just kept punching
him and punching him.

678
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:03,298
And I hated him so much.

679
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,301
He was Indian.

680
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:13,207
But it was raining.

681
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:14,609
There was a thunderstorm,

682
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:16,311
and I remember stepping outside.

683
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:18,146
And the clouds parted,

684
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,281
and the sun came out.

685
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:23,318
And I knew that that was God

686
00:44:23,353 --> 00:44:26,621
showing up for me in that moment.

687
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:30,191
He forgave me.

688
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:32,627
Jesus loves you.

689
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:35,530
And this was clearly just a test.

690
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:38,366
Amen.

691
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:45,073
Elliot, would you like to share?

692
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,510
No, man.

693
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:52,981
My system's hung.

694
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,882
God can help you.

695
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:02,824
Is that what God does?

696
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:06,594
He helps?

697
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,097
Tell me,

698
00:45:09,132 --> 00:45:11,432
why didn't God help my innocent friend

699
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:14,035
who died for no reason

700
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,537
while the guilty roam free?

701
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:22,877
Okay, fine.

702
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,278
Forget the one-offs.

703
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:27,248
How about the countless wars

704
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:29,684
declared in his name?

705
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:32,086
Okay, fine.

706
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,223
Let's skip the random,
meaningless murder for a second,

707
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:36,224
shall we?

708
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:39,127
How about the racist,

709
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:42,296
sexist, phobia soup

710
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:45,933
we've all been drowning
in because of him?

711
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:52,740
And I'm not just talking about Jesus.

712
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:57,478
I'm talking about all
organized religion...

713
00:45:57,514 --> 00:45:59,614
exclusive groups

714
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:03,084
created to manage control,

715
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,887
a dealer getting people hooked

716
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:07,555
on the drug of hope,

717
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,726
his followers nothing but addicts

718
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:13,628
who want their hit of bullshit

719
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:16,631
to keep their... their
dopamine of ignorance,

720
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,933
addicts afraid to believe the truth...

721
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:21,502
that there is no order,

722
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,938
there's no power,

723
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:26,641
that all religions are just

724
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:28,943
metastasizing mind worms

725
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:30,311
meant to divide us

726
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:32,113
so it's easier to rule us

727
00:46:32,148 --> 00:46:35,483
by the charlatans that want to run us.

728
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,024
All we are to them are paying fanboys

729
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:47,261
of their poorly written
sci-fi franchise.

730
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,835
If I don't listen to
my imaginary friend,

731
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,770
why the f... should I listen to yours?

732
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:03,111
People think their worship's

733
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:07,515
some key to happiness.

734
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,985
That's just how he owns you.

735
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:14,489
Even I'm not crazy enough

736
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:18,993
to believe that distortion of reality.

737
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:28,002
So f... God.

738
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:33,307
He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.

739
00:47:45,054 --> 00:47:47,655
Please tell me I didn't
say all of that out loud.

740
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:55,563
Shit. I did.

741
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,488
Angela and I are going
to have one more drink.

742
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,693
Oh, of course.

743
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:27,695
Of course.

744
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,263
Thank you for dinner, Phillip.

745
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:32,066
Mm-hmm.

746
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:33,201
Don't get up.

747
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:35,536
It was good to have met you.

748
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:37,805
Pleasure meeting you, Angela.

749
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:40,741
Now remember, come see us anytime.

750
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:41,943
We'll have lunch.

751
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:44,745
On you.

752
00:48:50,086 --> 00:48:52,286
So...

753
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:55,156
did you enjoy the semifreddo?

754
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:57,091
Was it all I promised?

755
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:58,326
Yes.

756
00:48:58,361 --> 00:48:59,594
Excellent!

757
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,262
Absolutely. It was delicious.

758
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:02,430
Good.

759
00:49:02,465 --> 00:49:03,898
And good company.

760
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,134
Jim's been with us for 27 years.

761
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,003
He's a Harvard guy... lives upstate.

762
00:49:09,038 --> 00:49:12,640
Three kids... two in
college, one in high school.

763
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,976
Company man through and through.

764
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:19,780
He's the reason we do our
Toys for Tots program.

765
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:21,349
And Saul is the chair

766
00:49:21,384 --> 00:49:24,318
of our nonprofit arm.

767
00:49:24,354 --> 00:49:26,754
Good man as well.

768
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:29,590
He has grandkids, so he's...

769
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:32,326
he's a little ahead in
the family department.

770
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:37,031
Oh, and another thing
they have in common:

771
00:49:37,066 --> 00:49:40,835
they were both in the room with Colby

772
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,265
when they made that grave error

773
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,841
covering up the leak in your hometown.

774
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,115
Hmm.

775
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,716
Ordinary men...

776
00:50:00,657 --> 00:50:05,092
Capable of extraordinary things.

777
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:15,403
Our CFO has discovered that
within the last two years,

778
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:18,906
both Jim and Saul have
been engaged in some

779
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:22,877
nasty insider trading.

780
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,578
Thick as thieves, these two.

781
00:50:24,614 --> 00:50:27,882
They like to buddy up on
their white-collar crimes...

782
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:31,352
a regular Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

783
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:47,268
There's enough evidence in there

784
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:50,037
to put them away for years.

785
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:06,587
I should get home.

786
00:51:06,622 --> 00:51:08,422
Your car will be out front.

787
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:14,462
Whatever you're doing, I don't trust it.

788
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,815
You're panicking right now.

789
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:37,551
I understand.

790
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:39,220
It's a big decision you're making,

791
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:42,056
because these men,

792
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:45,426
their lives will be destroyed.

793
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:52,933
But the minute you remove
emotion from this...

794
00:51:57,306 --> 00:51:59,173
You'll do just fine.

795
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:36,710
Heard you had an interesting night.

796
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:47,555
Chaplain's an old friend.

797
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,491
I threw it out for a reason.

798
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:51,992
I figured you might want it

799
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:53,027
for down the road.

800
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,863
Trust me, I've been there.

801
00:53:06,776 --> 00:53:08,909
Five years,

802
00:53:08,945 --> 00:53:10,678
seven months, three weeks,

803
00:53:10,713 --> 00:53:12,346
and two days ago,

804
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:14,081
my wife passed away.

805
00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:22,389
A few weeks of being
frozen in my own grief,

806
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:24,525
I woke up one morning,

807
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,061
fixed myself breakfast
like I normally do,

808
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:28,729
plugged myself into my dialysis machine

809
00:53:28,764 --> 00:53:30,831
like I normally do,

810
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,033
and started talking...

811
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:35,436
out loud.

812
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:38,005
For a second, I thought I was crazy.

813
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,340
Moved on with the day.

814
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:42,109
Then the next day, I did it again...

815
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:43,444
talked out loud...

816
00:53:43,479 --> 00:53:45,579
and the next.

817
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:48,082
And then I realized
who I was talking to.

818
00:53:53,556 --> 00:53:55,823
Why are you telling me all of this?

819
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:04,598
'Cause you and me

820
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:07,101
are a lot more alike
than you think, Elliot.

821
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:28,821
Are you crazy?

822
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,272
How the hell you knocking
on my door this early?

823
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:33,419
I'm sorry, Mrs. Romero.

824
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:35,387
I'm Dominique DiPierro with the FBI.

825
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:37,723
I'm assisting Homicide
on your son's case.

826
00:54:37,758 --> 00:54:40,025
I know it's early, but I just
had a few more questions

827
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:41,016
about your son's murder.

828
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:42,732
I already talked to the police!

829
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,408
I know the cops took all your joints.

830
00:54:52,443 --> 00:54:53,676
I looked through your files.

831
00:54:53,711 --> 00:54:55,211
I also know you have arthritis

832
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:56,679
and probably can't roll 'em yourself,

833
00:54:56,714 --> 00:55:00,816
so I'm guessing your son did.

834
00:55:00,852 --> 00:55:04,353
I can help roll 'em for
you if you'd like.

835
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:06,022
Used to do it all the
time for my kid brother

836
00:55:06,057 --> 00:55:07,523
back in high school.

837
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:09,525
He always told me I was
pretty bomb at it.

838
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:22,438
All right!

839
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:24,073
You can come on in.

840
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,780
Mmm.

841
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,115
Yeah, it's tight.

842
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:34,784
Not perfect,

843
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:37,420
but definitely doable.

844
00:55:37,455 --> 00:55:41,057
Yeah, it's not as fat
as my dear Leslie's.

845
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:42,958
That boy wasn't around much,

846
00:55:42,994 --> 00:55:45,227
but he was always doing for me.

847
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:46,362
Always.

848
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:47,563
God bless him.

849
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:52,401
I see you're moving out.

850
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:54,637
Ah, yeah.

851
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:56,205
I can't stay here no more.

852
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,907
I raised Leslie here,

853
00:55:57,942 --> 00:56:02,912
Huh. Too many memories here.

854
00:56:02,947 --> 00:56:05,781
Did he go anywhere or
do anything suspicious?

855
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:08,250
Any small detail could help.

856
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:10,119
Well, he be fooling around
with those computers.

857
00:56:10,154 --> 00:56:12,721
You guys know that.

858
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,824
He always did that since he was little.

859
00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:16,292
I never understood it.

860
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:18,594
Gobbledygook, if you ask me.

861
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:19,895
Did he have any friends?

862
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:21,464
Did anyone ever come to the house?

863
00:56:21,499 --> 00:56:22,932
Friends?

864
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:25,568
Leslie didn't have no friends,

865
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:27,436
except that chubby boy.

866
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:32,641
You mind if you get me...

867
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:34,343
grab me a glass of water?

868
00:56:34,378 --> 00:56:36,078
Should be some in the boxes.

869
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:37,379
Oh, yeah, of course.

870
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:41,183
That's right, you told the
cops someone did come,

871
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:42,485
but you didn't see him, right?

872
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,188
Nope, not with these cataracts.

873
00:56:46,224 --> 00:56:49,091
I can barely make you out from my cat.

874
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:51,128
Where is that thing, anyway?

875
00:56:51,162 --> 00:56:53,362
Probably ran off like everyone else.

876
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:00,603
Did he say his name?

877
00:57:00,638 --> 00:57:02,371
Have you seen him before?

878
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:04,173
Nope.

879
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:08,310
My mind was dancing in the clouds.

880
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:11,313
All I know is, I can't
live here no more.

881
00:57:14,418 --> 00:57:16,719
Now that I don't owe
anymore on the place,

882
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:19,655
maybe I can just rent it.

883
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,158
Yeah. Man.

884
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:23,626
Besides, I need the money.

885
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:38,207
$19 million.

886
00:57:58,095 --> 00:58:00,062
What do I do?

887
00:58:05,603 --> 00:58:08,304
Why did you start writing that
journal in the first place?

888
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:13,108
I thought it was the right answer.

889
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,610
The right answer to what?

890
00:58:17,548 --> 00:58:19,882
Controlling my life.

891
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:28,757
My wife...

892
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:31,227
well, she drove her car that day.

893
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:33,262
She did everything right.

894
00:58:33,297 --> 00:58:34,697
She always wore her seat belt,

895
00:58:34,732 --> 00:58:36,732
hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

896
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:40,269
She was the most perfect
driver I'd ever met.

897
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:43,839
It was... it was annoying.

898
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:46,408
She stayed in the lines.

899
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:49,878
Never went above or
below the speed limit.

900
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:52,214
Stopped at traffic signs.

901
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:54,818
She followed every rule.

902
00:58:57,622 --> 00:59:00,356
And then one day, none of that mattered.

903
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,464
Control is about as real

904
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:10,799
as a one-legged unicorn taking a leak

905
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:13,168
at the end of a double rainbow.

906
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:19,775
Then what do we have?

907
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:24,913
You know that bullshit
people say about how

908
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:26,682
when you fall,

909
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:29,151
you got to get up?

910
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,854
I reject that shit, man.

911
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:33,322
You know why?

912
00:59:36,494 --> 00:59:39,161
The whole thing is a fall.

913
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,032
It can't help but be.

914
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:46,969
A perpetual state of
grasping in the dark.

915
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:48,704
It's not about getting up.

916
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:50,506
It's about stumbling,

917
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,541
stumbling in the right direction.

918
00:59:52,576 --> 00:59:54,376
It's the only true way to move forward.

919
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:04,820
Whoever it is you wrote
about in your journal,

920
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:06,522
do you still see him?

921
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:16,031
I can tell the person
you're writing about

922
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:18,500
meant something to you.

923
01:00:18,536 --> 01:00:21,236
Sometimes he takes over?

924
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:24,039
That's why you don't remember things?

925
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:25,374
I shouldn't have come.

926
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:26,575
I don't want to talk about this.

927
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,210
Yes, you do.

928
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:31,580
'Cause you're smart enough to know

929
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,749
that keeping this inside

930
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:36,118
isn't going to last.

931
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:43,225
You play chess?

932
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,327
I've been looking for a good adversary.

933
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:46,595
Want to play?

934
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,885
What do you think?

935
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,754
Is Ray right?

936
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:17,292
Maybe it's not about avoiding the crash.

937
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:22,732
But it's about setting a breakpoint

938
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,133
to find the flaw in the code,

939
01:01:24,168 --> 01:01:25,401
fix it, and carry on

940
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:27,803
until we hit the next flaw...

941
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:30,472
the quest to keep going,

942
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:32,574
to always fight for footing.

943
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:40,716
Maybe we're all just stumbling
from the right questions

944
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:42,384
to the wrong answers...

945
01:01:44,122 --> 01:01:48,792
Or from the right answers
to the wrong questions.

946
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:50,259
It doesn't matter where you go

947
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:53,495
or where you come from,

948
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:55,831
as long as you keep stumbling.

949
01:01:58,502 --> 01:02:01,136
Maybe that's all it takes.

950
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:03,339
Maybe that's as good as it gets.

951
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:08,244
You got to be fucking kidding me.
