1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:04,250
It's almost as if
something's come alive.

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:06,347
My perfectly constructed loop.

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,983
At 8:00 a.m. breakfast
with my friend Leon.

4
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,218
At 2:00 p.m. we'll check
out a basketball game.

5
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,387
Two days a week I go to a church group.

6
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,822
You could use some practice.

7
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:16,190
If he's guilty,

8
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,359
I could destroy him at a terminal.

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,427
I told you not to look.

10
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,729
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, pumpkin.

11
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:23,364
You were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail,

12
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,598
and it was raining

13
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:26,166
when you decided my mother would die?

14
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:27,501
If you want to change things,

15
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:30,204
perhaps you should try from within.

16
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,206
You want me to convince the class

17
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,907
to remove the contingency.

18
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:36,277
You're gonna give me exactly
what I want in return.

19
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:37,411
I can't wipe the security footage

20
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:38,512
of you planting the femtocell.

21
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:40,247
Angela Moss.

22
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,548
You won't be able to give me

23
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,983
anything I want out of life.

24
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, I think so.

25
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,775
Oh, oh, Tyrell, Joanna,

26
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,944
meet my silent partner in crime,

27
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,312
Sharon Knowles.

28
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:46,814
I've heard many good things.

29
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,149
- And her husband, Scott.
- How are things?

30
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,318
Tyrell here is our new rising young star

31
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,753
with an eye on the CTO position.

32
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:54,154
But he's gonna have to wait

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,856
for Terry Colby's golf
career to take off

34
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,424
or for an early stroke.

35
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:03,263
Those earrings are stunning.

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,965
Thank you.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,302
Tyrell's always surprising
me with little gifts.

38
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,988
Capitalistic pig!

39
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:36,029

40
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:50,744
Hello.

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,579
I see you.

42
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,648
I recognize you.

43
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,518
I acknowledge your existence.

44
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,353
Let's talk.

45
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,854
Get to know who each other really are.

46
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,257
All of this is said with

47
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,858
a simple act of a handshake

48
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,693
between two people.

49
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,495
It's not any different than a client

50
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,898
connecting with a server.

51
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,400
It all relies on that first handshake

52
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,402
and naturally grows from there

53
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,439
for most people.

54
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,208
For me,

55
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,578
I can't seem to learn the rules.

56
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,552
What happened back there?

57
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,955
When you protected me.

58
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,926
What was that? I've
never seen that before.

59
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,562
That was what you needed.

60
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:51,205
Why were you trying to hide him?

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,307
- What are you talking about?
- Tyrell.

62
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:59,146
You were acting like he
wasn't in the trunk.

63
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,914
But Tyrell was there.

64
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,117
I saw him.

65
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,119
I thought we moved past this.

66
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,222
Let's not go backwards.

67
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:12,893
What are you so afraid will happen

68
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,061
if you tell me the truth?

69
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,563
Why do you want to know so bad?

70
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,666
Why do you even fucking care?

71
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:23,670
I don't want to be in denial anymore.

72
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:27,708
I just want to accept what I did...
and move on.

73
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,646
Fine.

74
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,682
I'll tell you.

75
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,862
What's the last thing that you remember?

76
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,201
Pop... popcorn.

77
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:58,038
I-I remember the popcorn.

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,978
Who the fuck?

79
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:11,184
I'm sorry, would you mind
holding for a moment?

80
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,186
Thanks.

81
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,055
I'll make this quick.

82
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,624
I'm Agent DiPierro, FBI
Cybercrime Division.

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,459
We co-opted one of your floors.

84
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:21,295
I was heading to my station when

85
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,163
I see you.

86
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,866
And it wasn't an "oops, wrong
floor" kind of drop-in.

87
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,569
From where I was, it looked like
you were coming from somewhere.

88
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:31,505
Now, this is nothing official
so don't worry, but...

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,806
I just had to ask,

90
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:35,542
what were you doing on
a restricted floor?

91
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,680
Making plans

92
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,182
with Agent Thomas.

93
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,518
We were trying to decide
drinks tomorrow or

94
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,487
lunch today.

95
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,923
Where'd you land?

96
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,259
Lunch.

97
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,894
A Greek place nearby.

98
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:58,699
How do you know each other?

99
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,100
I'm sorry, is there something else

100
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,269
I can help you with?

101
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,937
I just

102
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:07,274
really have to get back to
this call before lunch.

103
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,278
You know, this is the honest,

104
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:15,282
"cards on the table" truth,

105
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:18,952
your story fascinates me.

106
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:21,021
The luck...

107
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,525
To leave Allsafe a week before
the company gets hacked

108
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,428
and then to end up here at E Corp.

109
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,698
It's ironic given your history.

110
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,967
Okay, don't freak. She's got nothing.

111
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:36,570
If she did, you'd already be busted.

112
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,804
Well, I should quit babbling.

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,873
I was gonna have you
drop by soon anyway.

114
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,542
Drop by?

115
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,211
For what?

116
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:47,748
Just to get a statement, answer
a few questions, no big.

117
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,916
I'd be happy to.

118
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,119
I'm just really busy right now.

119
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,062
Whatever this is...

120
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,102
It's not you.

121
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,841
Okay, final command,

122
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:15,842
ifconfig,

123
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:16,910
space,

124
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,981
wlan1, space, up.

125
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:30,624
And there it is.

126
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,026
What?

127
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,929
We just owned the FBI.

128
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,715
I did it, didn't I?

129
00:07:55,884 --> 00:08:00,620
It was either us

130
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,856
or him.

131
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,771
How did I do it?

132
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,209
Well, you...

133
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:25,312
the guy was fucking batshit.

134
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:28,014
He was raving about

135
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,916
killing some woman and...

136
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,085
the wonder of it all.

137
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,688
I mean, we were gonna be next.

138
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,724
How did I do it?

139
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,763
After I ran the scripts,

140
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,699
he went off on us being gods.

141
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,771
The popcorn,

142
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:54,374
that's where Darlene
said she hid that gun.

143
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,712
And I didn't want to, but...

144
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,052
I shot him.

145
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,389
No.

146
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,960
I shot him.

147
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:23,737
Harder.

148
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,906
Harder.

149
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,413
Harder.

150
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,482
I told my friends you're coming.

151
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,320
You know that can't happen.

152
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:42,589
I thought this was our celebration.

153
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,991
We love each other. What's to hide?

154
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:48,395
Derek.

155
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,431
I mean, how many times
do you get to turn 30?

156
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,068
Either come to my party
tonight as my girlfriend

157
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,070
or we're done.

158
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,744
Pull up two hours ago.

159
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:16,590
Last week, any day.

160
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,606
The entire archive's corrupt.

161
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:35,175
Call the network team.

162
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,544
You guys just got hacked.

163
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,814
I'd sweep the 23rd floor and
check Angela Moss's computer.

164
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,183
You won't find anything... I'm
sure she erased all traces...

165
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,118
but check anyway.

166
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:47,153
Where you going?

167
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,655
It's Fourth of July tomorrow.

168
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,659
I'm gonna find a barbeque
to be miserable at.

169
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,875
Trash pile-ups have now become

170
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,644
a real epidemic in the city.

171
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,812
Due to the credit crisis
brought on by Five/Nine,

172
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,547
many private businesses cannot afford

173
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,149
waste management services,

174
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:17,817
which has sparked a cottage industry of

175
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,086
roadside garbage burning
at discounted rates.

176
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,988
The Taxi and Limousine
Commission asks that

177
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,990
drivers now accept Ecoin.

178
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,659
Per the Taxi and Limousine Commission,

179
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,928
payment can be made via mobile phone.

180
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:30,697
Just download the Ecoin
app from the Play Store

181
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,099
or App Store, scan the QR code

182
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,601
once you reach your destination,

183
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,902
and the payment will be withdrawn

184
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:37,604
from your Ecoin Wallet.

185
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:52,052
You had me worried, not
answering my calls

186
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,086
after all that went down.

187
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,087
I'm gonna go.

188
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,390
You weren't the target.

189
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,425
Cisco was just trying...

190
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,094
Stop.

191
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:05,231
I know you already put
the rest together, so...

192
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,234
no more smokescreens.

193
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,071
Okay, ask me anything, I'm an open book.

194
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,573
I owe you that.

195
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,644
You guys always thought that
you were smarter than me.

196
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,580
But come on.

197
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,417
You never actually hid it that well.

198
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,252
Every Halloween,

199
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,755
when we were kids,

200
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,725
you and Elliot always made me
watch that shitty scary movie.

201
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,793
It was so bad.

202
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,428
And all these years later,

203
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,431
I'd kind of forgotten about it.

204
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,902
Even when the masks started
popping up in those videos.

205
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,238
I didn't place it at first.

206
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,476
Maybe I did.

207
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:53,146
Maybe I didn't want to.

208
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,248
I mean, come on,

209
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:59,252
that's crazy, right?

210
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:02,422
That you guys would...

211
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,205
Had enough alone time down there

212
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,865
to get your head right and
do what needs to be done?

213
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,857
Speak up.

214
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,181
Yeah.

215
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
You believe him?

216
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,897
Yeah.

217
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:06,340
Okay.

218
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,643
This is how it's gonna go.

219
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:21,456
You gonna sit your ass right here

220
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,625
until you do what you got to do.

221
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:27,128
Once the site's up,

222
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:30,531
you gonna crawl back into your hole

223
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:34,535
until we're sure this baby's
purring like a kitten.

224
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,832
How long is this gonna take?

225
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,768
A few hours.

226
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,169
Once he gets what he wants...

227
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:10,304
Right now he needs me.

228
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,508
So that makes us safe.

229
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,117
What's with the looks?

230
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,118
Mm.

231
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,732
And this is happening tomorrow?

232
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,968
Mm-hmm.

233
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,076
Hello, Derek.

234
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,746
You never showed up.

235
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:28,683
Told you what would happen
if you didn't show up.

236
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:32,186
No-no-no-no-no, that's
not gonna work anymore.

237
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,690
You've been messing with
me for way too long.

238
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,225
I should've known

239
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,094
somebody that I met working
at a stuck-up E Corp party

240
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,863
would be bad news.

241
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:44,899
Meeting you at that party
changed something for me.

242
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,736
I'd be lost right now without you.

243
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,438
What you want,

244
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:53,441
I want it too.

245
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:57,445
I was busy tonight because I was
hassling my lawyer on holiday

246
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,481
to do this.

247
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,054
It's my birthday gift to you.

248
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,466
Holy shit.

249
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,902
We're getting more traffic than ever.

250
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,938
Says our Bitcoin intake
doubled since we've been up.

251
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,976
200,000 we could have
made while we were down,

252
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,412
that's on you, boy.

253
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:35,383
It's time to go back to
your cage, shitbrick.

254
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,319
What about a game?

255
00:17:38,354 --> 00:17:41,989
Old time's sake.

256
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,258
Give me and Elliot a minute.

257
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,294
Wait outside.

258
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,442
All right, set it up.

259
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:09,250
Thank you.

260
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,018
For what?

261
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:15,823
When we first met, I
thought I was helping you.

262
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,859
I thought I was gonna be your savior.

263
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:25,099
I didn't tell you about my wife.

264
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:27,568
She was so smart.

265
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:32,273
Way smarter than me.

266
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,275
She was like you,

267
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,444
real good with computers.

268
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,846
That's what she did for a living.

269
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:42,283
So when she had this idea to do a site,

270
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,686
it sounded good to me.

271
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,992
I don't think she ever meant
it to go where it went.

272
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:54,695
She was wanting to make
some extra scratch.

273
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,864
But the thing grew so fast,

274
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,134
it took on a life of its own.

275
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,336
And the money,

276
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,205
well...

277
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,340
We're talking about the
type of money that

278
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,744
makes you question right and wrong.

279
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,978
So, you know,

280
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,880
we made a deal.

281
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:15,816
Decided we'd let the market dictate

282
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,486
what was sold on the site.

283
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,521
And we wouldn't look.

284
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,193
She was better at the denial than me.

285
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:27,495
It ate at me,

286
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,898
all the things I imagined were going on.

287
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,701
I feared the worst.

288
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,569
But I still didn't look.

289
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:40,174
Not until you came along.

290
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:52,186
After I found out what was on there,

291
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,788
what we did to you,

292
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:56,223
what we did to RT,

293
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:59,060
it was weak.

294
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,798
Way back when,

295
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,800
when I said it was about stumbling,

296
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,802
I was wrong.

297
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:18,112
I should've taken a fucking stand.

298
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,323
You are my answer.

299
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:36,230
It's not the other way around.

300
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:42,570
So thank you.

301
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:02,623
How much time do I have?

302
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,764
Come on, man.

303
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,833
We both knew exactly
what you were gonna do

304
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,936
when I let you go back on that computer.

305
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,373
With their response time,

306
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:22,209
I would guess they have
us surrounded by now.

307
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:37,558
You better get out before
they get up here then.

308
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:40,728
World champion chess
master Emanuel Lasker

309
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,062
once said,

310
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:46,300
"When you see a good move...

311
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,970
look for a better one."

312
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,814
Elliot.

313
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:09,356
Be careful.

314
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:25,072
I gave Ray the chance
to make the right move.

315
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:29,577
And he left himself wide open to me.

316
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:45,059
When I completed the migration,

317
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,761
I also took it upon
myself to open the site

318
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:51,398
to more than just TOR traffic.

319
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,534
Stay right here and don't move.

320
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:55,936
Just had to index it on
a few search engines

321
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,438
and with the added touch of adverts

322
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:59,640
on the top advertising sites,

323
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:02,276
and now it's accessible
to any average scumbag

324
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:05,279
that Googles "Thai girls for sale."

325
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,715
Didn't take long for the FBI to catch on

326
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,051
after I emailed them an anonymous tip.

327
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:15,656
Mr. Robot was a part of me that
I created because of my pain.

328
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,892
So now we have a chance to start again.

329
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:22,129
Our handshake negotiated us as partners.

330
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:32,628
The House will come to order.

331
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:42,872
There has been much mystery

332
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:45,174
surrounding the vandalism and castration

333
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:47,009
of the Wall Street bull.

334
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:48,511
That mystery was solved when

335
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,446
the missing anatomy of the bull

336
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,182
crashed through a skylight
of the House chamber.

337
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:56,485
Police, FBI, and the Department
of Homeland Security

338
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,287
have begun a full-fledged manhunt

339
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:01,290
for those parties responsible.

340
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:03,792
You haven't answered my
calls since the weekend.

341
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:06,529
As you can see, it's busy.

342
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,497
Ever since this bailout
fiasco yesterday,

343
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,666
these kits are flying off the shelves.

344
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,169
The, uh, end of civilization is near,

345
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:15,371
so this is gonna have to wait.

346
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:17,606
I can settle the lawsuit.

347
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:21,577
Stay out of that.

348
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:22,745
The lawyers are handling it.

349
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,547
E Corp will settle.

350
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:27,983
But there's a contingency with
the independent inspections.

351
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,251
If we drop it...

352
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:30,586
I'm not discussing this with you.

353
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:32,821
If you drop the independent inspections,

354
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:34,223
they will settle.

355
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:37,860
Did... did your boss put you up to this?

356
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:43,499
Look at what's happening.

357
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:45,601
Who knows if this company
will be around long enough

358
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:48,237
to see this case through?

359
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,906
Drop the contingency.
You'll get your money.

360
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:53,509
The inspections are there for a reason.

361
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:56,011
Do you want what happened to your mom

362
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,613
to happen again?

363
00:24:57,648 --> 00:24:59,782
I'll make sure the inspections
go forward internally.

364
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:04,019
Is that how they're suckering you?

365
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,955
Trust me, they value me over there.

366
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:13,062
You laugh,

367
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:17,066
but they respect me.

368
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:19,969
I don't know who this person
is who's in front of me,

369
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:23,072
but I'm not agreeing to any of this.

370
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,608
I don't trust them.

371
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,910
And to be honest?

372
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:29,812
I don't trust you.

373
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,914
Besides, you think anyone
else is gonna want to

374
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,916
sign on to whatever you're selling?

375
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,884
It's not just my vote,

376
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,120
it's the whole class.

377
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,622
You need 2/3.

378
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:42,124
I already got the signatures.

379
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,930
That's the trick about money.

380
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,834
Banks care more about
it than anything else.

381
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:57,306
What exactly is in this for you?

382
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:00,175
You aren't getting the money. I am.

383
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:02,111
You know that, right?

384
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,979
So I'll ask you one more time.

385
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,948
Why did you come here?

386
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,718
Because you certainly didn't
give a shit about my opinion.

387
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:14,757
This was just a courtesy.

388
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,959
Two weeks and it's done.

389
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,410
Now this Ray thing got everyone talking.

390
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:44,553
I didn't have anything to do with that.

391
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,856
Lying ain't your friend right now, cuz.

392
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,826
Everyone got their eyes on you.

393
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:55,964
Half of them love you.

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,068
Half of them want to kill you.

395
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:03,439
Other half just want
to twist your shit up.

396
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:06,308
But you know, it's that last half

397
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:09,211
I'm worried about for you, bro.

398
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:10,579
Hey.

399
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:13,749
Little man, book it real quick for me.

400
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:20,856
I'm good here.

401
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:23,726
What's that?

402
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,394
Didn't hear you.

403
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,262
You heard.

404
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,906
Fucking

405
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:39,708
bravery

406
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:42,277
is contagious.

407
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:49,518
I suggest you talk to your boy.

408
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,954
He's fine where he is.

409
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,829
Ray's site.

410
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:57,399
I had 800 Bitcoins in my wallet.

411
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,768
Now, all of a sudden, I got no access.

412
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,521
Can't even make new sales
'cause the site's down.

413
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,668
All of this is on you.

414
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,029
So the way I see it,

415
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:11,973
you're paying me back.

416
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:20,042
We'll get some one-on-one

417
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,578
later on.

418
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:39,528
Just remember, cuz,

419
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:43,132
sitting under the Sword of Damocles.

420
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:49,471
Out of the blue,

421
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:51,974
I received a call from my lawyer.

422
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,310
Seems the contingency
on our biggest lawsuit

423
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:58,614
was miraculously dropped.

424
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,216
Care to explain?

425
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:04,086
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

426
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,454
I remember telling you

427
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,489
exactly the opposite.

428
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:10,159
You just didn't want to ask for it.

429
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,163
But it is what you wanted.

430
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,867
You gonna take the offer then?

431
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:24,306
Well, it's not for me to say,

432
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,009
officially, but...

433
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,178
despite the fact that
we're hemorrhaging money

434
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:30,846
at the moment,

435
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,514
settling this would
be a lot cheaper than

436
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,151
dealing with the legal expense.

437
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,654
Can I ask why it was
so important for you

438
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,523
to drop this contingency?

439
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:48,497
You protecting some

440
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:51,200
evil, secret agenda?

441
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:55,537
Aren't we all protecting our

442
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,840
evil, secret agendas?

443
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:05,681
In that case,

444
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,683
here's mine.

445
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,117
One of the things that Terry Colby

446
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:11,153
said to me when I took this job

447
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:14,890
was I could make changes from within.

448
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,727
I want my position moved

449
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:20,629
to the Risk Management Department.

450
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:22,631
There's a manager position available.

451
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,533
And even though I may
lack the experience,

452
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:26,735
I think you know I can
more than make up for it

453
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,903
with drive

454
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:29,471
and quick learning.

455
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:31,907
That's how you choose
to squander the capital

456
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:34,009
you've just earned...

457
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,878
You're aware that's a

458
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:37,079
lateral move?

459
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:39,047
It's what I want.

460
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:53,595
And I am asking.

461
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:04,206
It's my birthday today.

462
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,211
Did you know that?

463
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,245
No.

464
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:12,514
Hm.

465
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,782
- I thought...
- No, no...

466
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,250
Don't believe what you read online.

467
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,285
Today

468
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,088
is my actual birthday.

469
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:22,591
I never share the real one with anyone.

470
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,727
Some things I like to keep to myself.

471
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:33,068
Happy birthday then.

472
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,444
Would you like to

473
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,379
celebrate

474
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:47,082
with me?

475
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:49,351
Tonight?

476
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,191
No.

477
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:08,604
Well, maybe next year.

478
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,610
Wither thou goest to possess them

479
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,511
and thou succeedest them,

480
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:19,648
and dwellest in their land.

481
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:22,117
Amen.

482
00:32:22,152 --> 00:32:24,486
Amen.

483
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:45,340
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

484
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:47,976
For my outburst last month.

485
00:32:57,521 --> 00:32:59,721
Can you let go of me, please?

486
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:05,627
I know you're afraid,

487
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:08,797
but the fear you have is a right one.

488
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:12,968
It means you'll be forever vigilant.

489
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:15,203
You want to know how I know?

490
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:20,308
I've seen you talking to Him.

491
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:23,545
Not out loud, but I could tell.

492
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,682
It's written all over your face.

493
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:29,151
It's not crazy, Elliot,

494
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:33,055
it's very normal.

495
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,857
You've seen me talking to him?

496
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,592
Yes.

497
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,762
But you don't have to
keep it such a secret.

498
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:46,668
When you let Jesus into your heart,

499
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:49,538
He'll always listen.

500
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:56,878
Tell you what,

501
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:59,915
I'll give you some alone time.

502
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,986
I need your help.

503
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,258
I've been lost these past few weeks.

504
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:47,829
Since the whole Ray thing.

505
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:50,298
I need to finish what I started.

506
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:52,601
With Evil Corp.

507
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,736
But I don't know what to do.

508
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:11,720
Why did you first start listening to me?

509
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:16,625
When I sent you that note

510
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,629
on the server at Evil Corp,

511
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:24,199
something inside you told you to listen.

512
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:27,202
And you did.

513
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:28,970
Followed me off the subway,

514
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,640
came to fsociety,

515
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,041
and then you...

516
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:34,376
not me...

517
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:38,480
led us to hack Evil Corp.

518
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:41,216
I didn't force you to do any of it.

519
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,851
It was all you.

520
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,853
Your choice.

521
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:47,055
Truth is,

522
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,091
I just followed your lead.

523
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:57,933
People want to follow you, son.

524
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:01,670
Why?

525
00:36:01,705 --> 00:36:03,972
Same reason why you led the entire world

526
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:06,708
into a revolution.

527
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:10,145
Because you are a leader.

528
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:19,354
I don't want to be a leader.

529
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,523
You asked me how to finish this.

530
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,058
That's what you need to do.

531
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:26,094
You need to lead.

532
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:32,865
And not unlike your floor,

533
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,675
coffee machine, file room.

534
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,976
People in this bullpen, these are your

535
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:37,343
risk management coordinators,

536
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,811
you'll be working with this team.

537
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,980
Put out risk reports, analyses,

538
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:42,649
and you report everything out to me.

539
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:45,118
After Five/Nine, almost all of our time

540
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,655
is dedicated to helping
the crisis response team.

541
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,190
That's what we do here.

542
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:53,526
Our internal investigation team

543
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,562
make recommendations to management

544
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,497
about ways to

545
00:36:57,532 --> 00:37:00,667
address the crisis and course correct.

546
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,569
Need you to be smart.

547
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:05,238
Think outside the box and be discreet.

548
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:06,973
You get in; you get out;

549
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:08,341
assess the situation quickly;

550
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,642
find answers;

551
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:13,746
figure out ways to limit damage.

552
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:15,815
I'm giving you access

553
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,017
to the case we're working on now.

554
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:21,321
It's a class action
lawsuit brewing in Flint

555
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:24,657
over water contamination.

556
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:26,526
Nothing public yet, but

557
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:27,560
could be big

558
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:29,495
first quarter, 2016.

559
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:31,331
Do I just go into the file server

560
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:32,332
to access that?

561
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:33,833
I'll have IT

562
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,168
run you through everything.

563
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:38,338
Setup, Outlook, Calendar.

564
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,709
You knew Gideon Goddard?

565
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,510
We worked together on a couple projects

566
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:45,945
when he was a vendor.

567
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:49,248
It's terrible what happened to him.

568
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,251
Well, why don't you go ahead
and get yourself up to speed?

569
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,921
I'll check in once a week.

570
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:58,524
Let me know if you need anything.

571
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,736
Can I sit in on the
daily debrief meeting?

572
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:12,138
Look,

573
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:13,473
that's, uh,

574
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,241
that's a director-level meeting.

575
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:16,976
We don't really invite managers to that.

576
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:18,478
If I could just sit and listen

577
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,480
it might help me get up to speed faster.

578
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,148
I want to make sure I can add value

579
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,751
as soon as possible.

580
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,052
All right.

581
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,820
It's later this afternoon.

582
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:30,323
I'll send you an invite
with the details.

583
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,661
Did you get in

584
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:37,497
okay this morning with
these protestors out here?

585
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:42,635
It's crazy, right?

586
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,848
I was on a route to cure
myself of Mr. Robot.

587
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:59,085
The regiment was supposed
to be that path.

588
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,322
I never thought the
regiment would be the thing

589
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,159
that would lead me right
back where I started.

590
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:09,962
People always told me growing up that

591
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:12,165
it's never about the destination.

592
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,867
It's about the journey.

593
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:19,272
But what if the destination is you?

594
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:22,108
What if it's always you?

595
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,717
Hey!

596
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:31,951
Help!

597
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,524
I heard you got a problem.

598
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,293
You know what else your problem is?

599
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,360
Too much courage.

600
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,829
Just like your nigger friend.

601
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:43,963
He might tell you it's a good thing,

602
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,231
but it ain't always.

603
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,200
It makes you have errors in judgment.

604
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,036
But I'm gonna do you a solid.

605
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,305
I'm gonna fix that courage
problem of yours.

606
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:58,077
Okay.

607
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:03,649
We should break that brave,
little soul of yours, homey.

608
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:07,587
You could've avoided this if
you'd just given me my money.

609
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:09,155
Think about that.

610
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,158
Think about it.

611
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:14,894
Think about it.

612
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:16,929
No, no!

613
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,618
Gonna get a letter on Tuesday.

614
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,920
Do what it says.

615
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,199
Hey, yo, man,

616
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:57,637
when you see Whiterose,

617
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,339
make sure you say I did you good.

618
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,919
I'll be rooting for you, cuz.

619
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:15,322
Always.

620
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,339
Usually, they feed us.

621
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:35,340
It's one of the only reasons

622
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,541
to come to these meetings.

623
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:38,109
Should we go ahead and start?

624
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:39,877
It doesn't look like
Susan's gonna make it.

625
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:41,212
Is there any reason to have
this meeting without her?

626
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,847
The economy must really
be in the shitter

627
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:46,751
if Susan Jacobs finally decided
to take her vacation days.

628
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:48,519
First order of business

629
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:50,622
is the small independent loan
companies we're servicing.

630
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:51,856
I'm surprised they're not suing us

631
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,291
for breach of the uptime clauses.

632
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:54,459
I have three class actions on

633
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:55,927
that point alone in my region.

634
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:57,862
Contractual damage on
uptime are minimal.

635
00:41:57,897 --> 00:41:58,963
I'm not even worried about it.

636
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,598
We'll settle.

637
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,900
But we should discuss those
when Susan comes back.

638
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:05,403
Maybe it would be helpful
if I put together a summary

639
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:08,539
of how we've... handled past cases.

640
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:10,041
To see if there are any
patterns that might

641
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,944
help us figure out how
to address this issue.

642
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,914
If we pull milestone cases

643
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,284
like Dakota Fracking and

644
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,119
Washington Township,

645
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:24,088
I could put together a summary briefing.

646
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,994
All I would need is access to the files

647
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,530
and then I could get working
on that right away.

648
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:50,248
You know what?

649
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:53,184
There's not much we can do here today.

650
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:56,321
Food never came, Susan's out.

651
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:57,755
Let's adjourn.

652
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,190
Didn't I just say that two minutes ago?

653
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:00,792
We're really leaving before the food?

654
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:02,860
I said adjourned.

655
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:22,280
I know who you are.

656
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,448
You did what you did

657
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:25,149
to get a job here.

658
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,618
You sucked whoever's dick
to get transferred here.

659
00:43:27,654 --> 00:43:30,221
And, frankly, I don't really care.

660
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:35,493
This is a favor to Price.

661
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:37,362
You know what he told me,

662
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:39,931
when I asked him how I
should deal with you?

663
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,634
He said, and I quote,

664
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,671
"However you want."

665
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:58,549
Enjoy the shrimp cocktail.

666
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:03,454
This is good news, don't you think?

667
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,966
But you're not happy about it.

668
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,738
I'm not sure.

669
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:23,741
When did you get it?

670
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,110
This morning.

671
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,049
How are your interactions with him?

672
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:35,753
For the first time,

673
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:38,790
we trust each other.

674
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:42,126
I help him, and he helps me.

675
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,263
Since I've been at my mom's,

676
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:48,466
I wanted to get rid of him.

677
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:52,303
But you were right.

678
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:56,340
You can't destroy a part of yourself.

679
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:06,184
Elliot, I need to ask you a question.

680
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:11,022
Where do you think you are right now?

681
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:17,161
What do you mean?

682
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:25,803
Elliot,

683
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,974
you know you haven't been staying
with your mother, right?

684
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:32,577
I know.

685
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:51,596
When you get released,

686
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:55,766
I hope you continue
seeing me in my office.

687
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:59,370
I think it's important we
maintain our regular schedule.

688
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:03,207
Don't you agree?

689
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,642
Yes.

690
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,181
Mr. Robot was right.

691
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:20,558
Control can sometimes be an illusion.

692
00:46:20,593 --> 00:46:24,228
But sometimes you need
illusion to gain control.

693
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:36,073
Fantasy is an easy way to
give meaning to the world,

694
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:40,244
to cloak our harsh reality
with escapist comfort.

695
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:44,482
After all,

696
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:48,586
isn't that why we surround
ourselves with so many screens?

697
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:52,823
So we can avoid seeing?

698
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,559
So we can avoid each other?

699
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,360
I don't think I'm ready to

700
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,229
talk about it just yet.

701
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:01,065
So we can avoid truth?

702
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:07,171
I'm sorry for not
telling you everything.

703
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:11,175
But I needed this in
order to get better.

704
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:17,214
Please don't be mad too long.

705
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,051
This will be the last time
I keep things from you.

706
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:22,687
I promise.

707
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:43,074
I know what you're thinking,

708
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:45,242
and no.

709
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:47,244
I didn't lie to you.

710
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,647
See you in the morning.

711
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:51,816
All of this really happened.

712
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:53,818
This was just my way of coping with it.

713
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:55,620
But now, I'd like it if

714
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:59,090
we could trust each other again.

715
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:01,758
Let's shake on it.
