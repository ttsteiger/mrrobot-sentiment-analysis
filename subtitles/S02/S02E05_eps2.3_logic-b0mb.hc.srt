1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,383
We might be owned.

2
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:02,063
Dark Army.

3
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,656
The world's most dangerous hacker crew.

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,661
They think the FBI's
even snooping around,

5
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:07,585
and it gets ugly.

6
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,367
They keep asking me questions.

7
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:10,925
I'm gonna keep telling your story,

8
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,468
but if shit goes down and I get busted,

9
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:13,769
I'm not gonna get locked up.

10
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,705
My husband will return soon,

11
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,340
and this'll all be over.

12
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,874
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's

13
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,476
climate control system.

14
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,013
Take care of yourself.

15
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:25,214
There will be fallout from this,

16
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:26,249
and I'm gonna tell them...

17
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,616
I used your computer,

18
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,452
so tell them whatever you want.

19
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,220
The server keeps crashing. I
don't know how to stop it.

20
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:32,521
We need to find someone who can do

21
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,023
that migration thing
he keep talking about.

22
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:36,392
You hack people. I hack time.

23
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:40,229
_

24
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:41,964
Someone's closing in on us.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,499
I have to find out what they know.

26
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,534
My online business is
very important to me.

27
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,836
I prefer discretion.

28
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,871
What exactly are you doing?

29
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,706
I'm hacking the FBI.

30
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,334
_

31
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,596
Step one: identify the
target and its flaws.

32
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,097
There are always flaws.

33
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,866
I learned that early in life.

34
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,035
My first hack, the local library,

35
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,571
a vulnerable FTP server in its AS/400.

36
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:25,207
A far cry from the Android
zero days I'm using

37
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:28,244
to own the FBI
standard-issue smartphone.

38
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,745
The library was a test to see

39
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,048
if I could even get into the system.

40
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,016
I've since set greater goals.

41
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,918
For instance, step two:

42
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:38,521
build malware and prepare an attack.

43
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,057
At my fingertips, the zero
day is wrapped in code

44
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:44,293
like a Christmas present,
then becomes an exploit,

45
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:48,364
the programmatic expression of my will.

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,132
I live for this shit.

47
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,405
Step three: a reverse
shell, two-stage exploit.

48
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,207
The ideal package.

49
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:01,043
Load the malware into a
femtocell delivery system,

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,645
my personal cell tower

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,114
that'll intercept all mobile data.

52
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,816
Similar to my first time,

53
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,251
when I found myself staring
at late book fees,

54
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,787
employee names, member addresses.

55
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,594
Everything was revealed.

56
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,963
The secret of the perfect hack?

57
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:22,565
Make it infallible.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,834
Hidden within the
kernel is a logic bomb,

59
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,669
malicious code designed to execute

60
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,971
under circumstances I've programmed.

61
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,807
Should the FBI take an
image of the femtocell,

62
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,010
all memory will
self-corrupt, or "explode."

63
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,012
Step four: Write the script.

64
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,681
Why do it myself?

65
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:40,516
Because that's how I learned, and I know

66
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,185
exactly what, when, and
how it's going to run.

67
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,788
I didn't do anything
harmful my first time.

68
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,156
Just looked around.

69
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,858
But I felt so powerful.

70
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,127
11 years old and in complete control

71
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,696
of the Washington
Township Public Library.

72
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,331
Today is different.

73
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,799
I hacked the world.

74
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,668
Final step: launch the attack.

75
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,770
Once I do, I'll own the Android phone

76
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,206
of every FBI agent in that building.

77
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll own Evil Corp's network,
applications, everything.

78
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,612
Domain Admin.

79
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,148
This, the thrill of pwning a system,

80
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:13,816
this is the greatest rush.

81
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,050
God access.

82
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,486
The feeling never gets old.

83
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:33,502
I'm gonna need to talk
to the old sys admin.

84
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,643
The old IT guy,

85
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,212
set this up.

86
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,481
There's an encrypted
database on the old server

87
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,383
I'm gonna need access to.

88
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,386
You wanna talk to RT?

89
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,355
If that's his name.

90
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,391
I'll talk to Ray,

91
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,959
see what's what.

92
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,749
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

93
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,900
Jeez Louise, look at that.

94
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,821
What the hell are you doing here?

95
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,022
How did you get in?

96
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,491
Penetration test. You failed.

97
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:12,294
I'm done anyway.

98
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,196
What is this?

99
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,831
I haven't seen you in five weeks

100
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,599
and now you're just in my home?

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,705
Leave. Now.

102
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,408
Okay, if you want the FBI to
find out you were the one

103
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,711
who illegally put a CD
into a drive at Allsafe

104
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,913
that set off the crime
of the millennium,

105
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,881
be my guest.

106
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,251
- He told you?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,987
And he cleared Allsafe's
logs to cover your ass,

108
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,724
but now with the FBI's
Five/Nine investigation,

109
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,126
this could all lead back
to both you and Elliot.

110
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:47,896
Why didn't he say anything?

111
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:49,998
Because that's what he does,

112
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,301
and now it's time for you to help him.

113
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,375
What exactly do you want from me?

114
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:17,393
Before I tell you,

115
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:20,963
I need you to keep reminding
yourself that this is simple.

116
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,600
Your gut instinct is gonna be
screaming a big fucking no,

117
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:27,236
and I need you to suppress that instinct

118
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:31,206
and remind yourself that this is simple.

119
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,243
If this little preface was
supposed to inspire confidence,

120
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,411
you're failing miserably.

121
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,712
I'll give you a small device,

122
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,147
which you'll take to work,

123
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,082
drop at the Fed's office
on the 23rd floor,

124
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,884
and walk away.

125
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,385
Simple.

126
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:47,756
Here it comes,

127
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,292
that gut instinct I was talking about.

128
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,094
Are you out of your mind?

129
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,833
You want me to hack the FBI?

130
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,469
What possible good would that even do?

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,771
Once we have access to their system,

132
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,307
we can make all of the bullshit go away.

133
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:08,010
Any evidence they have
on you and Elliot,

134
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,978
gone.

135
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:13,449
I'll take my chances.

136
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,192
Fine, play it how you wanna play it,

137
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,627
but I hope for Elliot and your sake,

138
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:28,030
no one else knows about that CD.

139
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:47,483
This is not our usual
time nor place to meet.

140
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,751
It was very risky for me to come here.

141
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,189
Talk to me. What's happened?

142
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,461
I don't wanna do this anymore.

143
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,330
I lied to the FBI,

144
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,664
and they know it.

145
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,866
They're not stupid.

146
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,300
They saw me sweat.

147
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,835
Now my phone is tapped.

148
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,071
Anytime I make phone calls,

149
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,540
I hear interference, voices.

150
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,016
I mean, who are we protecting?

151
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,718
Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?

152
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,756
Part of our agreement was

153
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,992
that you would not ask any questions.

154
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,361
You're right. You're right.

155
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,763
I just...

156
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,565
I know someone is watching me.

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
I can tell.

158
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:41,570
On the train, at work, in my apartment.

159
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,171
How do you know?

160
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,340
I just do.

161
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,576
I feel it, you know?

162
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,421
Thank you

163
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,223
for sharing this with me.

164
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,992
I promise you everything will be okay.

165
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,972
Hello, sir. You can't be here.

166
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,307
- I work here.
- Not on this floor.

167
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,976
Can you help this guy out?

168
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,578
We really need to close off
this elevator on-beau.

169
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:40,589
Firefighters are already
battling fierce blazes...

170
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,765
I hate coming here. Security's so lax.

171
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm still in the middle
of this deep dive

172
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,203
on the hard drive reports that
came back from Forensics.

173
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,776
I had that dream again.

174
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,580
Except this time, I was
walking down a steep hill,

175
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:06,115
and at the bottom was that same man

176
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,583
wearing a surgical mask.

177
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,786
He never tries to kill you?

178
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,656
Nope. Just staring.

179
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,028
You really don't dream, do you?

180
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:22,197
Never interested me.

181
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,433
You read Santiago's email?

182
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,270
Let me guess: you're excited.

183
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,506
Fuck yeah, I'm excited.
We get to go to China.

184
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,176
Yeah, well, just so you know,
I throw up on planes, so...

185
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,111
bring a raincoat and nose plugs.

186
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,149
Any updates on her?

187
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,850
Surveillance said she mostly stayed home

188
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:43,986
and then went to a yoga class.

189
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,221
Then they lost her again.

190
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,191
I'm telling you, it's hard
to track people in New York.

191
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,367
Where's the she-devil?

192
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,906
Don't know.

193
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,341
Something's wrong.

194
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,309
Darlene's never quiet unless...

195
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,011
Did the malware not check out?

196
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:12,514
It's Angela.

197
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,318
You need to talk to her.

198
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,220
About what?

199
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:21,757
With the FBI at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

200
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,159
We don't have time to prep a
new social engineering attack,

201
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,995
- so I went to her...
- She can't be involved.

202
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,564
What the hell else do you want me to do?

203
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,566
I am telling you, it's a fortress.

204
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,201
There's no way in there right now,

205
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,269
and it's as if we have
a lot of time to wait.

206
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,605
- Darlene's right.
- I'm not doing it.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,407
Who better than someone you trust?

208
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,009
I'm not discussing Angela with you.

209
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,244
She's our only option.

210
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,679
She's not an option.

211
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,614
Think of something else.

212
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,383
I did my part.

213
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,218
Now you do yours.

214
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:55,257
Make this happen.

215
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,620
Minister Zhang, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

216
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,989
The pleasure is mine, Mr. Santiago.

217
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,224
Welcome to China.

218
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,194
Oh, here.

219
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:15,938
Let's retire into the forum,
where we can talk in private.

220
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,342
As you'll see in your escorted tour

221
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,177
of Beijing's backup facility,

222
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,179
our attack was not climate control

223
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:25,547
like your raspberry pi.

224
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,649
Our backup tapes were degaussed.

225
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,017
We'd like to visit

226
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,653
all four of China's backup sites.

227
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:32,888
Of course.

228
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:34,156
And be granted access

229
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,359
to the encrypted E Corp servers.

230
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,994
Absolutely.

231
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,731
Excellent.

232
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,734
Now...

233
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,670
there is another subject to discuss.

234
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,375
We understand it is a delicate subject.

235
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,810
The Dark Army?

236
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,114
We'd like to review all
intelligence you have on them.

237
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,763
It's just that...

238
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:17,366
some of us think that, you know,

239
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:20,269
they as a... as a known
malevolent hacker group

240
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:21,304
might have...

241
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,671
Of course.

242
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:23,839
We'll get you all of our dossiers

243
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:26,608
with any intel we might have.

244
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:28,610
You're schedule to visit
our Beijing facility

245
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,546
on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

246
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,715
Enjoy yourselves. Take in the city.

247
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,585
Monday night, I wish to
host you at my home.

248
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,788
A reception to celebrate our...

249
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,857
collaborative effort.

250
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,381
You can't just do it yourself?

251
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:21,645
No, not without access to the database.

252
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,147
But you're the best.

253
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,751
The master.

254
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,085
Ain't that true?

255
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,256
You gotta understand.

256
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,358
I hesitate because RT
and I didn't part ways

257
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:38,094
on the best of terms.

258
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,697
Yeah, come on!

259
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,400
I wouldn't ask if there
were another way.

260
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,703
You're wasting time, time we don't have.

261
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:49,606
You need to call Angela.

262
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,208
Maxine, what's wrong, girl?

263
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:55,578
Shh, don't make me think the worst now.

264
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,350
Is she okay?

265
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,722
If you say you need him,

266
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:09,125
you must need him.

267
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,861
I'll have RT stop by.

268
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:13,830
Son, y'all know y'all can't jump.

269
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,151
I tracked the last package

270
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:38,722
to the Midtown post office
it was mailed from.

271
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:41,057
However, there's no evidence
on the security footage

272
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:43,727
of anyone mailing it
from inside the station.

273
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,763
It was probably dropped in
a nearby collection box.

274
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,833
And I have a contact attempting
to trace the phone calls,

275
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,434
but he needs more time.

276
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,470
I'll keep you updated as always.

277
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,340
Good night, ma'am.

278
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,975
And Kareem?

279
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,282
I did as you asked.

280
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,061
Framed burglary.

281
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,263
Cops'll likely go after

282
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,265
an ex-con who lives on the same floor.

283
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,902
MO matches other B&Es
the guy's suspected of.

284
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,387
Tell me...

285
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,555
tell me about his death.

286
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:51,895
Succinylcholine.

287
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,431
Injected as ordered.

288
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,834
And he didn't feel anything?

289
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:01,638
He was completely paralyzed.

290
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,851
It'll appear there was a struggle.

291
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,020
He pulled his gun in self-defense.

292
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:19,088
The attacker got him first.

293
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,857
Two gunshot wounds: one to the chest...

294
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,126
Another to the head.

295
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,328
Did he look at you

296
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,298
before you finished the job?

297
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,466
Yes.

298
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:32,769
Ma'am, if I may,

299
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:34,771
why drug him?

300
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:38,174
It would have been just as
easy to shoot and leave.

301
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,444
Killing a man instantly

302
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,480
robs him of explanation.

303
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:48,384
He has no time to process
his final moments.

304
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,854
Now, even though he was paralyzed,

305
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,489
his mind was still able to understand

306
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,491
why his life was ending.

307
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,996
We let him die with answers.

308
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,601
Otherwise...

309
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:08,338
We're nothing but ruthless murderers.

310
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,713
Thank you.

311
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:00,924
- Hey.
- Hi.

312
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:03,927
I gotta say, I never thought

313
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:06,029
I'd ever hear from you again.

314
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:08,031
I ordered you a Bud Light.

315
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,400
Thanks.

316
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:12,135
You know, I'm...

317
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,304
I'm glad we're sitting here again.

318
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,239
Our old spot.

319
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:17,941
You know,

320
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,709
booth over there by the window.

321
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,311
Remember?

322
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,279
It's where I first said
the three magic words.

323
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:26,950
Yeah, no, I don't think I remember that.

324
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:30,253
"I... love... you."

325
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,558
I-I meant it too.

326
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:40,029
I-I miss you, Angela.

327
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:42,465
Thanks.

328
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,068
Yeah, a lot of... lot of...

329
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:47,136
lot of good memories.

330
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:49,906
And look, Josh Groban night.

331
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,942
It's like we're, uh,

332
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,445
reliving our glory days.

333
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,947
But, uh, you, wow.

334
00:22:57,983 --> 00:23:00,583
I mean, I hear things are
going great with you.

335
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,518
I hope this is cool

336
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,253
and not, like, weird,

337
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,155
but, um, I brought my résumé,

338
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:08,925
if you can... if you can do anything.

339
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,763
Well, I just figured, hey,

340
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,065
if there are any open positions...

341
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:22,672
I'll see what I can do.

342
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,941
So tell me.

343
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,377
How's life over there?

344
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,979
Very different than Allsafe.

345
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,681
You miss it?

346
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:33,249
Yeah.

347
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:38,187
And Gideon.

348
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:40,523
Crazy sad.

349
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,825
You know, I heard the
dude that shot him was,

350
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,560
like, off his rocker.

351
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:47,130
One of those, uh, Five/Nine truthers.

352
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:49,065
Some people even say that
the whole thing was,

353
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,134
uh, like, a put-on.

354
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,802
Like a... like one of those,

355
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,838
uh, crisis performances or whatever.

356
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,174
You know... you know,
those Frank Cody types.

357
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,643
Anyways, tragic for sure.

358
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:05,548
So you ever think that CD
had anything to do with it?

359
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:18,661
Excuse me?

360
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,363
I'm just saying, like,

361
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:23,866
Allsafe was... was ground zero.

362
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:30,807
What the fuck?

363
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:38,714
Are you working with the FBI?

364
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,784
No, it's...

365
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,586
My uncle is a lawyer.

366
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:45,922
He told me to be careful and
record any suspicious...

367
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:47,523
- It's my uncle's fault.
- What the fuck?

368
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,293
What... oh, come on!

369
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:52,095
My contract was cleared
because of the hack.

370
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,429
I can't afford a new phone.

371
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:55,031
Answer me.

372
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,267
Honestly. Right now.

373
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:00,970
Did you talk to the FBI?

374
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,573
No.

375
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:04,608
Yes.

376
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,242
I me... I mean, Angela,

377
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,144
look, they called me
in, like, three times.

378
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,446
I can't sleep. I am scared as shit.

379
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,982
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

380
00:25:13,017 --> 00:25:14,784
Just about the CD guy,
and then they did,

381
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:17,120
like, the sketch or whatever,
the facial composite thing,

382
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,956
but I swear, I never said your name.

383
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,224
Wait, where are you going?

384
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,492
Where...

385
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,081
This food is not sanitary, am I right?

386
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:49,016
I mean, where's the
General Tso's chicken?

387
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,985
I don't think that's a formal
hors d'oeuvre in China.

388
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,154
Yeah? I'm gonna ask.

389
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,657
This noodle bowl thing made me gag.

390
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,493
These people are savages.

391
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:22,283
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

392
00:26:22,318 --> 00:26:24,051
Bathroom?

393
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,621
Um, toilet?

394
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:28,890
No English?

395
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,858
Okay, thank you.

396
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,900
Pardon me, do you have the time?

397
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:14,302
Oh, shit.

398
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:19,674
Mr. Zhang, I...

399
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,643
I was just admiring... looking at...

400
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:23,878
for the...

401
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:27,482
Oh, right, the time 'cause of the...

402
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:29,851
You've wandered very far from the party.

403
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,587
I was looking for the
little girls' room,

404
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:34,722
and then I... And this caught your eye?

405
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:40,962
Yeah, I...

406
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,530
I know it seems a little uncanny,

407
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:44,031
but my parents had the same clock

408
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,834
in our family room growing up.

409
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,937
I found this in Germany.
The town of Rothenburg.

410
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,539
Cost me a fortune.

411
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,808
The seller told me that
it was one of a kind.

412
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:57,478
So much for the honest salesman.

413
00:27:57,514 --> 00:28:00,314
My parents bought theirs
at a Kmart in Teaneck.

414
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,951
Oh, is that where you're from?

415
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:06,287
- Miss...
- Jersey born and raised.

416
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:08,022
And my full name is Dominique DiPierro,

417
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:09,457
but I go by Dom.

418
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:11,125
Or Agent DiPierro.

419
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,327
Or just Dom.

420
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:18,666
So if I can ask,

421
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,067
what's the deal with the clocks?

422
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:24,038
Is it a punctuality thing?

423
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:27,208
"Life is but a walking shadow,

424
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,744
"a poor player that struts and frets

425
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:32,647
"his hour upon the stage

426
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:35,449
and then is heard no more."

427
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,320
You've surrounded yourself

428
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:42,156
with the constant reminder of mortality.

429
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,192
There's much work to do, great work.

430
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:46,928
As each second passes,

431
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:49,730
I push myself to keep moving.

432
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:52,500
You're making me think I should invest

433
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:53,834
in a decent watch.

434
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,607
Now, if I may ask,

435
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:01,208
how does a young woman from New Jersey

436
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:03,377
find her way into the FBI?

437
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,516
I was...

438
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,218
I am...

439
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:14,855
disgusted by the selfish
brutality of the world,

440
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,793
but at the same time, I'm
utterly fascinated by it.

441
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:21,762
The FBI's a perfect place for
that kind of contradiction.

442
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,335
I have something in my office
I think you might appreciate.

443
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:33,374
The artist strives to reflect
the desolation and anxiety

444
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:36,944
that accompanies one's loss of identity.

445
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,581
His message is subversive
to many in our country.

446
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:44,085
Nevertheless, the work
appeals to the masses

447
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,253
and to the individual.

448
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:50,057
How is it that revolution can
create such beautiful art

449
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:51,759
yet you and I are
tracking revolutionaries

450
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,228
who've created nothing but turmoil?

451
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,134
There's more to the story.

452
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:01,569
I'm sorry?

453
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:03,070
FBI.

454
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,039
Why you joined.

455
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:10,144
What was it?

456
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,147
It's a little personal.

457
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:15,750
That's precisely why I'm asking.

458
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:19,420
Oh.

459
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,125
Okay.

460
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,293
Um...

461
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:31,332
Well, it was a certain relationship.

462
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:35,503
A love story?

463
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:40,975
Of sorts. Sort of, sure.

464
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,877
Final semester of law school,

465
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:45,513
dating who I thought was the one,

466
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:46,847
at dinner,

467
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:50,351
days before graduation...

468
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,687
they got down on one
knee to propose, and...

469
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:00,895
This is gonna make me sound wacky,

470
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,164
but I...

471
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,267
excused myself to the restroom
and went out the back, and...

472
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,639
That was that.

473
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:13,674
Fast-forward several
years, I turn around,

474
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,644
and here's what I picked instead.

475
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,046
A mid-level field agent.

476
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:27,655
- What is it?
- I just...

477
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,558
Uh, I never would have...

478
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:33,861
expected to be talking
about an old flame

479
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:36,597
to China's minister of state security.

480
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,366
Ah.

481
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,168
It'll make a good story at Thanksgiving.

482
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,536
My dad'll love it.

483
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:56,050
Whose room is this?

484
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,726
Wow.

485
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:08,062
These are gorgeous.

486
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:09,864
A magua,

487
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,434
the common Manchu clothing
of the Qing Dynasty.

488
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:14,902
Detailed embroidery such as this

489
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:17,271
was often reserved for
the royal families.

490
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:21,575
This is a modern qípáo

491
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:23,444
by Jin Zhi Yu Ye.

492
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,945
Purchased in Shanghai.

493
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,782
The silk fabric and embroidered
lace are unrivaled.

494
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:29,183
Here.

495
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:35,790
Wow.

496
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:41,262
I've never touched
something so beautiful.

497
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:44,231
I feel the same way each time.

498
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:50,271
Where did these come from?

499
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:52,473
They belong to my sister.

500
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:55,442
She stays here when she's
passing through Beijing.

501
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:05,319
Let me ask, Miss DiPierro,

502
00:33:05,354 --> 00:33:08,689
have you ever wondered
how the world would look

503
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:12,026
if the Five/Nine hack never happened?

504
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:15,496
How the world would look right now?

505
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,933
In fact, some believe there
are alternate realities

506
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:21,936
playing out that very scenario,

507
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:24,438
with other lives that we're leading...

508
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:28,042
Other people

509
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,844
that we've become.

510
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,321
The contemplation moves me very deeply.

511
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:50,798
Wow, you weren't kidding.

512
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,833
You really do have a thing...

513
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,635
I apologize, I must go.

514
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,637
May I escort you back to the party?

515
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:28,002
Why are you here?

516
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:29,970
Because I wanna be.

517
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:33,908
I told Darlene I didn't
want you involved.

518
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:36,343
She was right to involve me.

519
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,446
Please don't do this.
I'll find another way.

520
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,949
Darlene said it's a simple job.

521
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:46,453
I place the device on the
floor and walk away.

522
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,389
Then you guys will make
everything go away,

523
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:49,623
any evidence that you find.

524
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,492
That's true, right?

525
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:56,063
- Right?
- That's our plan.

526
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,598
But that's not the point.

527
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,533
Don't put yourself at risk.

528
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,302
I've run through my options.

529
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:03,037
Best-case scenario: I lose my job

530
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:05,239
and plea-bargain down a jail sentence.

531
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:07,308
I'm backed into a corner.

532
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,177
Either I act, or I wait to get caught.

533
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:16,884
I told myself that I would
wait to decide until I saw you

534
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,819
because you wouldn't
let me walk into this

535
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:21,455
unless you were sure that
you could pull it off.

536
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,196
I've decided.

537
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:39,373
I miss you. You know that, right?

538
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:44,111
I reached out to you so many times,

539
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:47,181
and you kept saying no.

540
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:49,283
Can I just know why?

541
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:55,489
I keep thinking about that day

542
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:58,258
on the train platform.

543
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,828
After you found me in the cemetery.

544
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:06,633
You told me to take care of myself.

545
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:08,769
I wanted to be okay.

546
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:14,708
I wanted to s-stop seeing him

547
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:17,511
before I talked to you again.

548
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,482
And?

549
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:31,792
And my dead father's standing
behind you right now.

550
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:49,476
I can be a friend.

551
00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:54,548
Someone to talk to.

552
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,984
Someone who cares about you.

553
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:01,555
Who knows? Maybe that will help.

554
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:09,063
How's Qwerty?

555
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:11,665
He's good.

556
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:16,070
He's fat.

557
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:18,338
I think I'm feeding him too much.

558
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,081
This is the federal bailout.

559
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,479
All right, this is
critical, and you're just

560
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,878
backing out of our biggest operation?

561
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:31,306
This isn't open for debate.

562
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:34,132
I can't go, and it's none of
your goddamn business why.

563
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:41,439
I want you to lead the D.C. op.

564
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:43,056
You're being promoted.

565
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,948
Take the crew down to
the Capitol tonight

566
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:46,383
and begin prepping.

567
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:47,784
You serious? Really?

568
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,886
Well, you've done good.

569
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,622
Now take charge. Act like a leader.

570
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:55,959
This is a very serious opportunity.

571
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:58,161
- You know the plan, right?
- Oh, yeah.

572
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:00,196
Good. Don't forget the package.

573
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,299
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

574
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:04,734
I'm not gonna let you down.

575
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,469
All right, I'm gonna do you proud.

576
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:08,371
- And they're gonna remember fso...
- Okay, just do your job

577
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:09,639
and stop acting like such a pussy.

578
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,141
I gotta take this.

579
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:15,345
Hello?

580
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:19,616
When?

581
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,657
There's an encrypted users database

582
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:30,026
in the marketplace directory.

583
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:32,829
Here, um, just...

584
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:35,065
let me drive.

585
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,240
You gonna ask or just stare?

586
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:47,811
Okay, what happened?

587
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:52,749
It was a rhetorical question.

588
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:54,684
Just stare.

589
00:38:57,556 --> 00:39:01,124
This guy obviously knows his shit.

590
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:04,027
Why did Ray come to me?

591
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:21,578
Then you'll, um...

592
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:25,215
transfer the archives
to the local machine.

593
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:41,331
And then transfer the existing site

594
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:42,732
from the local machine

595
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:46,436
to the new server.

596
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,891
_

597
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:11,759
_

598
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:24,446
_

599
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:27,806
_

600
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:38,255
You don't know when to stop.

601
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,792
This is what you wanted, remember?

602
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,760
Me, here at a terminal.

603
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,003
Good to go.

604
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,839
Uh, check on it if you need to.

605
00:41:37,983 --> 00:41:39,282
Everyone has their own

606
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:41,351
if/then conditional programming,

607
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:44,154
a situation where if certain
conditions are met,

608
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:46,289
then a logic bomb detonates.

609
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:49,326
Everything blows up in your face.

610
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:53,263
Is this Ray's if/then moment or my own?

611
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:35,138
If Ray is running the site himself,

612
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:37,140
why bring me in?

613
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,309
Maybe he doesn't know the
evil that he's spreading.

614
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:41,978
Maybe he has no idea what's on the site.

615
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,481
Ray is protective, kind.

616
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:47,150
Ray is dangerous, a criminal.

617
00:42:47,186 --> 00:42:49,052
Are those his two halves?

618
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:50,820
Which side of him is stronger?

619
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:53,023
Is he sinister enough to host the...

620
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:56,026
Stop figuring this out.

621
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:58,528
I wanna know.

622
00:42:58,564 --> 00:43:01,498
You know.

623
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:04,067
But you're going to ignore it.

624
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:06,236
You wanna know why?

625
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,338
Because that's what we do.

626
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:12,642
It's not what I do.

627
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:16,880
If he's guilty,

628
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:18,615
I could destroy him

629
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,717
in under two minutes at a terminal.

630
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,086
Are we really back to this again?

631
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,956
Ray is not some coffee shop owner.

632
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:29,759
Forget what you saw and move on.

633
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:35,265
You're thinking only of yourself.

634
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,467
I'm thinking of us.

635
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:43,440
And I'm thinking of the
people in those pictures.

636
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,847
I could help them.

637
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,687
We have other battles to fight.

638
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:05,262
What else is new?

639
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:15,005
A logic bomb explodes
either at a set time

640
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,307
or when a specific condition is met.

641
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:20,277
And now I've met Ray's
black market of evil.

642
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:22,612
Mr. Robot can deny it all he wants,

643
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:24,581
but I can't.

644
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,416
Can you?

645
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:42,165
Hello?

646
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,444
_

647
00:44:48,034 --> 00:44:50,203
_

648
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:54,277
Tyrell...

649
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:56,862
_

650
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:02,439
Were you followed?

651
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:05,408
No, I don't think so.

652
00:47:05,444 --> 00:47:07,277
Did you take the route I sent you?

653
00:47:07,312 --> 00:47:09,145
Yeah.

654
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:11,181
Where's your cell phone?

655
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:13,249
At home.

656
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:15,251
No bullshit from here on.

657
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:17,020
Understand?

658
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:43,446
Oh, my head is pounding.

659
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:45,515
Way too much of that
Baijiu drink last night.

660
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,485
Speaking of, where'd you go?

661
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,488
I got stuck listening to Jesse
trying to speak Chinese.

662
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:53,556
He made a lot of people
really uncomfortable.

663
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:55,658
Oh, you know, your average evening.

664
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:57,994
A private tour from
Minister Zhang himself.

665
00:47:58,029 --> 00:47:59,295
What?

666
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:01,731
Was he putting, uh, moves on you?

667
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:03,533
No, not like that.

668
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:06,169
But he did take me to
his sister's bedroom

669
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:08,505
and show me her clothes.

670
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,173
- That's sort of weird.
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,641
Even more so when you consider

672
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:13,877
Minister Zhang doesn't have a sister.

673
00:48:13,912 --> 00:48:17,080
Nice look, Hollywood.

674
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:18,681
Thanks. I got myself all gussied up

675
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:20,550
for the field trip.

676
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:22,886
- Where's Santiago?
- On another rampage.

677
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:24,921
ADIC called with updates
about the raspberry pi.

678
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:26,422
- Great.
- Not great.

679
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:27,891
Turns out the guy who found it

680
00:48:27,926 --> 00:48:29,592
smudged his fat fingers all over it,

681
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:31,227
smearing any possible prints.

682
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:32,862
Another dead end.

683
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,731
When Santiago stomped
off, he was threatening

684
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:36,866
to reach through his cell
phone and castrate the guy.

685
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:39,068
Fantastic.

686
00:48:39,104 --> 00:48:40,603
Think I'm gonna need more caffeine

687
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,572
to survive the day.

688
00:48:57,322 --> 00:48:59,889
Get them kids out of there!

689
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:39,495
Hey! Hey!

690
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:41,798
Hey! Help!

691
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,233
Ah!

692
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:46,903
Stop! Help!

693
00:49:46,938 --> 00:49:48,838
Help!

694
00:49:52,043 --> 00:49:53,109
Fuck.

695
00:49:57,449 --> 00:50:00,617
You are one stupid fucker.

696
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,587
Never trust a guy with a rattail.

697
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:06,522
Too easy to carve secrets out of.

698
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:23,506
Ray...

699
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,808
what are you doing?

700
00:50:25,844 --> 00:50:28,211
I told you not to look.
