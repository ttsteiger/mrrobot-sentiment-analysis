1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,688
_

2
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:47,494
Anything?

3
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,663
Nothing yet.

4
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,419
Who is that? Who is that,
that guy on the bike?

5
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:47,788
He looks like he's coming
straight toward me.

6
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,156
Okay, he's closing in. We're coming.

7
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,390
- No, wait.
- It's too risky.

8
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,661
- We need to fly in.
- Wait.

9
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:59,900
Are you... from E Corp?

10
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,302
- Who are you?
- Just making a delivery.

11
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,304
Please sign here.

12
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,667
- What is this?
- Someone grab the biker.

13
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,202
- Grab the biker.
- No, no, no,

14
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,204
they haven't picked up the money yet.

15
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,284
Mr. Knowles, we don't recommend that.

16
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,286
We should have our unit search it first.

17
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,813
Sir, are you all right?

18
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,248
Should we come in? Are you all right?

19
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:27,387
Is that your phone?

20
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,022
You have ten seconds to do what it says,

21
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:33,026
or every Bank of E
system will be bricked.

22
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,899
Sir, who was the caller?

23
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,613
Mr. Knowles, what are you doing?

24
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,733
There's no way.

25
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:55,437
We've already committed $900 billion.

26
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:58,240
It would be irresponsible
if the feds sent more.

27
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,608
And we're not going
to ask the government

28
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,610
to pony up the cash.

29
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,046
How do you burn through
that kind of money

30
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,314
in 30 days anyway?

31
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,950
You have something right... right there.

32
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,553
Finally you're seeing my point.

33
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:14,423
No, no, on your face.

34
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,058
The point is, Phillip,

35
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,294
we've already given you our
burst of cash on hand.

36
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,895
We can't give you any more.

37
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,664
Well, we'll sell the
T-bills to the Chinese,

38
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,932
and that money in return

39
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,733
will be used as a loan for our company.

40
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,137
Look, the real recovery program
is months from being done.

41
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,239
The public is hoarding cash.

42
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,408
The housing market is
grinding to a halt.

43
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,777
The big three are on
the verge of collapse.

44
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,946
Everyone at the commission
needs to see results

45
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,480
within the next three weeks

46
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:40,649
before we can do anything else.

47
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,585
Look, rebuilding our database

48
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,954
is the only solution to this problem.

49
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,789
This is not my opinion.

50
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,624
These are the facts,
ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,427
Now, I've cooperated
with you on every level.

52
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,630
I even have the goddamn FBI
working out of my offices.

53
00:06:54,665 --> 00:07:00,665
Janet, Mary, Jack, please.

54
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,171
Tell me you didn't ask me

55
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,806
to fly down all the way to D.C.

56
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,842
just so you could, what,
hear yourselves complain?

57
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,380
You've got to resign.

58
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,848
We have no other options.

59
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,316
The President can't go to Congress

60
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,352
with a bailout right now.

61
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:27,563
In the fallout of the Great Depression,

62
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,168
FDR closed all the banks
for a bank holiday,

63
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:36,405
and then he reopened them in stages

64
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,011
when they were reported to being sound.

65
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:46,148
Later, historians discovered
what we in this room now know,

66
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:50,819
that those reports,
they were mostly lies.

67
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:54,657
Nevertheless, it worked.

68
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,860
It worked because the public believed

69
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,296
the government had
everything under control.

70
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:06,902
You see, that is the business model

71
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,437
for this great nation of ours.

72
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,606
Every business day when
that market bell rings,

73
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,109
we con people into
believing in something,

74
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:18,180
the American dream, family values.

75
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:21,417
Could be freedom fries for all I care.

76
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:24,386
It doesn't matter

77
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,756
as long as the con works

78
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:32,127
and people buy and sell

79
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,164
whatever it is we want them to.

80
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:40,803
If I resign,

81
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:44,807
then any scrap of confidence

82
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:50,842
the public is already clinging
onto will be destroyed,

83
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,248
and we all know

84
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:57,419
a con doesn't work

85
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,456
without the confidence.

86
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,395
If this was the best idea

87
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,265
you could come up with for a win,

88
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,835
I shouldn't be the one resigning.

89
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,772
I have to head back to New York.

90
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,607
Let me know when you've
locked up the votes,

91
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:24,642
and wipe your goddamn mouth.

92
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,986
Well?

93
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,322
You moved.

94
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,358
And?

95
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,229
Now I'm gonna punish you.

96
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,554
Ahem.

97
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,089
Ah, you know, usual, coffee,
black, turkey sandwich

98
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,692
on whole wheat, lettuce,
mayo, muenster cheese.

99
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,160
Already working on it.

100
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,929
You always take good care of me, Ahmed.

101
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:48,430
How's the wife doing?

102
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,566
She's good, she's good, thank you.

103
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:51,733
Oh, I haven't seen her in a while.

104
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,936
Where is she these days?

105
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,371
- Our daughter is sick.
- Oh, that right?

106
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,807
That's too bad.

107
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,508
- Now, which one is she again?
- Sally.

108
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:02,344
Sally, uh, the young one, right?

109
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,747
- Yeah.
- Sally, such a pretty name.

110
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:09,117
Now, is that traditionally
an Iranian name, or...

111
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:12,020
Come on, lady, I'm in a rush here.

112
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:14,890
Jesus H, all right.

113
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,692
God, Calm down.

114
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,127
Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed,

115
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:19,895
before I get lynched over here.

116
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:25,734
_, am I right?

117
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,839
Um...

118
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,744
and this?

119
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,780
DiPierro, he's waiting for us.

120
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,249
Yup.

121
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:23,125
When you look closely at
the seams between order

122
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,193
and chaos,

123
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,163
do you see the same things I see?

124
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,198
The strain, the tears,

125
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:33,936
the glimpses of truth hidden underneath.

126
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,771
Why do they fight so desperately

127
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,472
to mask what they are?

128
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,675
Or is it that they become who they are

129
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,810
when they put on the mask?

130
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,279
Sometimes I wonder what you hide behind,

131
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:45,814
my silent friend.

132
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,483
What mask do you wear?

133
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,453
Or are you just as afraid
as the rest of them?

134
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,455
Me?

135
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,057
Am I afraid?

136
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,558
Nah, man.

137
00:12:56,593 --> 00:13:00,062
I'm different.

138
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:04,466
Hey, dipshit,

139
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,469
can't you see we need the ball?

140
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,043
- This ball?
- Yeah, that ball.

141
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,144
What, you slow or something?

142
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,813
What's up?

143
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,916
Nah, I ain't slow, bro.

144
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,017
Go get your own ball.

145
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,485
- Yo, man.
- What?

146
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,020
What's your problem, son?

147
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,588
- What's your problem?
- You my problem.

148
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:27,923
You need to learn how
to speak to people.

149
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,257
Oh, you need to have respect, son.

150
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:31,259
I got it.

151
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,868
Hey, I got it.

152
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,285
We're all just here to
have a good time, right?

153
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,287
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,539
Maxine's been acting
a little off lately.

155
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,775
She really perked up when she saw you.

156
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,711
You a dog person?

157
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:26,314
Used to have one.

158
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,449
Oh, yeah?

159
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:30,552
What happened to it?

160
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:34,156
Don't have her anymore.

161
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,191
Hmm.

162
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:44,399
Elliot, right?

163
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:45,835
I'm Ray.

164
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,002
I've seen you here before.

165
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:51,273
You must like the games, huh?

166
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,407
They put Bradstreet in.

167
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,109
He's good on the boards.

168
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,144
Come on, boys.

169
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,952
Look at these guys. What do you see?

170
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,320
A lot of care and effort

171
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,689
over what amounts to a
pretty shitty game.

172
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:09,758
What's Maxine see?

173
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:12,761
A bunch of dumb animals,
can't think past anything

174
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,630
but getting a ball in a hoop.

175
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,934
What do they want you to see?

176
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,336
Badass homies...

177
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:24,940
ready to kill if you step to 'em.

178
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,175
Question is...

179
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:29,311
which is the truth?

180
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,679
Maybe all of 'em.

181
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,714
Maybe none of 'em.

182
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,151
Maybe truth don't even exist.

183
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,820
Maybe what we think is all we got,

184
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,389
which is why I'm a little
jealous of Maxine over here,

185
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:44,860
'cause all she gives a shit
about is eating and sleeping.

186
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,028
Ain't that right, girl?

187
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,971
Not the loquacious type, I get it.

188
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,740
Me, I talk all the time,

189
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,909
but I guess you picked up on that.

190
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:03,411
It's cool though. Communication...

191
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,914
is good for my line of work.

192
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,717
Takes a lot of it to
run a good business.

193
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,519
But unlike you, when
it comes to computers,

194
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,487
well,

195
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:15,357
I get them about as much as
Maxine here gets E. E. Cummings,

196
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,825
so when I heard...

197
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,893
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

198
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:21,229
I don't do that anymore.

199
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,198
Just tell him you'll help.

200
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,734
Try it once, huh?

201
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,602
Let that old feeling come back.

202
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,437
You know, this morning
over breakfast my wife

203
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:32,374
told me I'd make a friend today.

204
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,575
Not many people to talk to around here

205
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,044
except for these knuckleheads.

206
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,414
It's cool if we continue talking?

207
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,449
No, thanks.

208
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,387
Damn, man.

209
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,691
That's some cold, brutal
shit right there.

210
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,693
I'ma have to go listen
to some Adele on repeat

211
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,828
when I get back home.

212
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:02,537
Okay, I can take a hint.

213
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,573
Come on, babe.

214
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:11,346
How long you gonna keep us
in this analog nightmare?

215
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,750
As long as it takes.

216
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,118
Without my weapon of choice,

217
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,622
Mr. Robot is unplugged, powerless.

218
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,224
He'll try to wear us down,

219
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,326
but as long as we stick to the regimen,

220
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,261
he can't take control

221
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:31,099
no matter how much of an
illusion he thinks this is.

222
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,335
I mean, it's a disgrace,

223
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,139
an absolutely disgrace police
have not found this guy.

224
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,741
Not only does all the evidence

225
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,111
behind the Five/Nine
attacks lead to him,

226
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,146
but he is the leading suspect

227
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,415
behind the Sharon Knowles murder.

228
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,318
I've said it before. I'll say it again.

229
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:54,589
The misogynistic blind eye by
law enforcement in this...

230
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,957
My problem, Stassi.

231
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,792
I hit her for a (BLEEP) reason.

232
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,361
She (BLEEP) my ex-boyfriend...

233
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,129
Hey, "Vanderpump's" on.
You want to watch?

234
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,697
- Another time.
- You know what?

235
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:06,434
I'll walk away and let
this be about you.

236
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,703
How was I that time? Did I do okay?

237
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,472
I didn't hurt you too bad, right?

238
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,107
You're spoiling it again.

239
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:16,478
At least I didn't break a couple up.

240
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,047
Do you want to go have
a drink at the bar?

241
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,315
You know, I know the guy who works here

242
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,317
makes awesome mescal cocktails.

243
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,852
We used to bartend together
back at this place...

244
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,688
We're not to be seen together, remember?

245
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,156
That was our agreement.

246
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,664
That's him, isn't it?

247
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:40,201
Freaks me out. Can't he wait downstairs?

248
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,237
He's doing his job.

249
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:50,178
She's still in the tub.

250
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,016
You said 2:00. It's 2:15.

251
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:00,588
Hand me a towel?

252
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:07,929
Go.

253
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,431
We can't leave together.

254
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,214
So unfair.

255
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,016
She came out of nowhere a month ago.

256
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,685
Sometimes I see her talking to herself.

257
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,754
Oh, my gosh, you did too?

258
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,956
So weird.

259
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,524
Yeah, Melissa hates her too.

260
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Shit, I got to take this.

261
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,763
I'll call you back.

262
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,631
I'm telling you, it's non-negotiable.

263
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,966
No one's going to let you

264
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,134
take that question off the table.

265
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,569
The money burning is a big part

266
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,703
of why everyone wants the exclusive.

267
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,472
Bloomberg, line two for you.

268
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,474
Except for CNN, which
you guys don't want...

269
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,476
I got to call you back. Hi, Foster.

270
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:55,543
I thought the deadline was noon.

271
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,045
It's noon now.

272
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,480
It's five past, Angela, and...

273
00:19:58,482 --> 00:19:59,981
Ryder's agreeing to the questions.

274
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,250
He's also giving us top
of the hour and Kelly.

275
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,752
Price doesn't even like Kelly.

276
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,487
I'll budge on the time slot,

277
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,088
but I can't on the question.
It's fair game.

278
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,590
Talk to the segment
producer and call me back.

279
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,425
Angela, I already know the answer.

280
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,760
You were supposed to make this
happen five minutes ago...

281
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,828
Just call me back.

282
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:14,996
Call Markinson.

283
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,297
We don't want CNBC,

284
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,433
or Fox News, for that matter.

285
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,768
I think you should let
Melissa handle this.

286
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,405
- Done deal?
- Not gonna happen.

287
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,607
Scott Knowles burning $5.9 million

288
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,242
is on the table or not at all.

289
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,576
We're going with CNBC.

290
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:30,078
They're sending a deal memo as we speak.

291
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,946
You know I would rather go with you.

292
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,615
You got to twist their arm.

293
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,650
Bullshit.

294
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,758
Did you just hang up on Bloomberg?

295
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:46,928
Are you trying to get fired?

296
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,129
Leave.

297
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,800
Excuse me?

298
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,002
Leave.

299
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,204
When Melissa finds out...

300
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,839
Get her.

301
00:20:57,874 --> 00:20:59,374
Go ahead and get her. Tell
her whatever you want,

302
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,243
but right now get out
of my fucking cubicle.

303
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:47,655
Fine, we'll take it off,

304
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:48,890
but we're talking about the bailout

305
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,191
and Plouffe's suicide.

306
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,326
I can't do Plouffe.

307
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,328
Then we're walking for real.

308
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:55,163
Segment producer is pissed
that this is what...

309
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,731
The guy committed
suicide on national TV.

310
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,066
It's out of respect for his family.

311
00:21:58,101 --> 00:21:59,667
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

312
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:01,035
You don't want to ask about that.

313
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,606
Please, it's been a month.

314
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:09,444
One question, and I have to approve it.

315
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,879
Hi, Melissa.

316
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,747
Bloomberg TV agreed to all the points

317
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,182
on the exclusive.

318
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:17,252
Foster's sending you the deal memo.

319
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:20,588
I need to get coffee
before the staff meeting.

320
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,559
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,959
Coming up to the city
was just a nightmare.

322
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:18,440
The tunnel was at a snail's pace.

323
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:19,629
E-ZPass is down again.

324
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:20,970
They're saying indefinitely this time,

325
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,305
but I cannot take the
train in this heat.

326
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,598
It must have been in the 90s today.

327
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:27,373
Okay, sorry.

328
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,509
So?

329
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:32,712
I've decided to stay.

330
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,213
We agreed to discuss this.

331
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:38,050
We have for several weeks now.

332
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,752
Need I remind you I was against

333
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:41,220
you taking Colby's job
offer in the first place?

334
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:43,089
And then even when you convinced me

335
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,024
that we should wait to
see where it would lead,

336
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,860
we agreed it was only gonna
be for a brief trial basis.

337
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,129
I think we were both clearly
wrong about their motives.

338
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:51,964
Oh, I think you are being naive.

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
And I don't think that we need
to have these talks anymore.

340
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:57,570
I like my job, and I'm not quitting.

341
00:24:57,605 --> 00:25:00,339
That's my decision.

342
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:25,798
You never had any intention
of leaving, did you?

343
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:29,235
I know you think they're
pulling something,

344
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,470
but that's because you
can't imagine anyone ever

345
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:34,807
valuing me as a real asset,

346
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:39,011
when the truth is I've done
more for you and the lawsuit

347
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:43,950
than you've ever done
for me or yourself.

348
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,419
I have value,

349
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:50,289
and even though you
don't see it, they do.

350
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:55,428
They are barbarians in $10,000 suits,

351
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,764
but I see your resolve.

352
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I know when to cut my losses.

353
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:11,477
A guy walks up to a woman at a bar.

354
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,812
He flirts with her.

355
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:14,480
He makes small talk,

356
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:16,882
but the woman insists she
isn't gonna go home with him.

357
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:20,152
Guy says, "What if I
offer you $1 million

358
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,887
to sleep with me?"

359
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:23,823
The woman's never had a
million dollars in her life.

360
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:28,060
She stops and considers
the offer very seriously.

361
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,363
The guy changes his mind, says,

362
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:31,798
"What if I change my offer

363
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,566
to a dollar instead?"

364
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,401
Woman is aghast.

365
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,503
"What kind of woman do you think I am?"

366
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:40,539
Guy says, "We already figured that out.

367
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:42,541
Now we're just negotiating."

368
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:06,032
Are you alone?

369
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:23,976
Welcome to positive
affirmations volume three,

370
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,779
success and money.

371
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,418
You'll hear the affirmations
repeated twice.

372
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,820
I will leave a space for
you to either repeat

373
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,189
mentally or out loud.

374
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,358
Please use this on a consistent basis

375
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,794
to form new neural pathways.

376
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:45,264
Good luck.

377
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,467
I am confident.

378
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:51,437
I am confident.

379
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:56,142
I am confident.

380
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,644
My confidence is powerful.

381
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,480
My confidence is powerful.

382
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:05,151
My confidence is powerful.

383
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:08,354
I recognize myself as exceptional.

384
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:11,223
I recognize myself as exceptional.

385
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:15,327
I recognize myself as exceptional.

386
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,898
I will follow my dreams no matter what.

387
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,233
I will follow my dreams no matter what.

388
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,711
Come on, sit down.

389
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:42,354
Maxine wanted to come over and say hi.

390
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,090
She missed you.

391
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,425
I think the damn dog

392
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:49,695
might actually like you more than me.

393
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,397
See that smile?

394
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:01,106
Even though we're
technically not friends,

395
00:30:01,142 --> 00:30:02,775
I told my wife we were,

396
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,812
was too embarrassed to say otherwise.

397
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,019
You know, you two would get along.

398
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,288
She likes to ignore me too.

399
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:18,190
Hey, man, I don't mean to be an asshole,

400
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:22,228
but like I said before, I'm all good.

401
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:30,903
Sorry, I actually don't
know why I'm laughing.

402
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:33,239
I though you made some joke I don't get,

403
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,740
so I usually just fake laugh at those,

404
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,642
but...

405
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:39,979
really, I'm confused.

406
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:43,549
I thought we were on the same page.

407
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:46,952
About what?

408
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:50,489
When we spoke last night.

409
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,759
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

410
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:56,195
I didn't see you last night.

411
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:12,177
You really don't remember.

412
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,089
You feeling okay, chief?

413
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:45,945
That's what the control,
the regimen, the journal,

414
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,314
my perfectly constructed loop,

415
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:49,982
what this whole thing's been about.

416
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,166
Last night till this morning,

417
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:09,802
while I was sleeping, I
can't account for it,

418
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:11,904
a gap in my consciousness,
and somehow he...

419
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:17,076
What do they see when
they see you coming?

420
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,578
And this is why I'm different.

421
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:22,014
Sometimes my mask takes over.

422
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:26,318
Why did you talk to him?

423
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,921
Because I'm gonna make you realize.

424
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,956
What?

425
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,062
What will you make me realize?

426
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:47,773
That they see me.

427
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:07,986
What's so funny?

428
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:09,655
We started a movement.

429
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,989
We were meant to lead it.

430
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,758
Now, get back on a terminal now.

431
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:15,928
Give me what I want or keep shooting me.

432
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,203
Tell me where Tyrell is,

433
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:27,973
or shoot me again

434
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:32,144
'cause the only one it's
gonna drive mad is you...

435
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,113
not me.

436
00:35:08,883 --> 00:35:12,351
I'm late for my church group.

437
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:14,386
Peace.

438
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:22,594
This time targeting
the Bank of E network

439
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,730
in an elaborate ransomware attack.

440
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:27,666
The malicious malware targeted
the bank's computer servers

441
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:29,268
and spread to multiple branches

442
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:31,203
in North America, encrypting the data

443
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:33,672
and rendering the systems unusable

444
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,440
until a ransom was paid.

445
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:37,776
This more militant variant
of the hacker collective

446
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:40,512
forced Scott Knowles, the CTO of E Corp,

447
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:44,550
to burn $5.9 million in public view.

448
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:47,019
Shortly thereafter pictures
surfaced on social media

449
00:35:47,054 --> 00:35:50,055
under the name #OPdailyallowance.

450
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,057
Now, this is considered
a direct response

451
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:54,359
to E Corp's unpopular program,

452
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:57,095
which would lower their daily
cash withdrawal allowances

453
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,698
for customers to $50.

454
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:02,034
Some stunt, huh?

455
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:05,537
Everybody's laughing it
off as a dumb prank,

456
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:08,207
but these guys know what they're doing.

457
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:12,311
Who thought that hard cash would
be this valuable right now?

458
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:15,047
We're reliving Black Tuesday,

459
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:17,382
the Great Depression.

460
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,084
Warning lights were flashing.

461
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,054
I mean, in the last two years

462
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:23,722
the Army Corps of Engineers,

463
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:25,891
the Energy Department,
the State Department,

464
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:28,827
and the Office of Personnel Management

465
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:30,562
were all hacked.

466
00:36:30,598 --> 00:36:33,098
The government claimed they
were boosting security,

467
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:36,068
but what came of it?

468
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:38,103
The same as 1929.

469
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,274
Shit hit the fan.

470
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:50,148
An act like this changes
people, changes society.

471
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:53,285
I'm just having a drink.

472
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
I'm sorry,

473
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:58,957
and I'm rambling like a fanatic.

474
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,829
Is there something else
you want to talk about?

475
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:08,100
The beaches of Barbados,

476
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:12,304
espresso on Rue Montmartre,

477
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,606
sitting around a campfire
in the Adirondacks?

478
00:37:14,642 --> 00:37:17,776
I'm married.

479
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:19,811
I'm Brock...

480
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:24,483
and I know you're Gideon Goddard.

481
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:30,856
- I watch way too much news.
- God.

482
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:34,026
I can't believe I'm a tabloid sensation.

483
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:37,396
More of a diehard fan.

484
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,031
I got a smile.

485
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,066
I'm on a roll.

486
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:47,039
When did he leave you?

487
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:49,007
What, was that on the news too?

488
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:52,044
No, just your face.

489
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:58,517
It's obvious why they
use you as their patsy.

490
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:01,653
You give off a very sympathetic

491
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:05,090
and honest vibe.

492
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,226
You're the perfect
vessel for their lies.

493
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,228
Yeah, well, I don't... I don't know

494
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:13,932
what to say to that, but, uh...

495
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:16,601
I'll agree with you that
it sure as hell feels like

496
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,304
there's something bigger
than me in control.

497
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:25,110
Thank you.

498
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:26,945
For what?

499
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:29,881
Tomorrow I'm gonna be a hero.

500
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:35,687
I'm sorry?

501
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:39,691
You may just be a patsy, but
you're an important one.

502
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,927
In fact, I don't think I've ever met

503
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:44,963
a bigger crisis actor than you before.

504
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:50,068
This is for our country.

505
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:50,529
And there shall be no more death,

506
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:53,432
neither sorrow nor crying,

507
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,701
neither shall there be any more pain,

508
00:39:56,737 --> 00:40:01,139
for the former things are passed away,

509
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:03,375
and he that sat upon the throne said,

510
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,111
"Behold, I make all things new,"

511
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:07,712
and he said unto me,

512
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:13,718
"Write, for these words
are true and faithful,"

513
00:40:13,754 --> 00:40:15,687
and he said unto me, "It is done.

514
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:18,523
"I am Alpha and Omega,

515
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,693
"the beginning and the end.

516
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:24,963
"I will give unto him that
is athirst of the fountain

517
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:29,167
"of the water of life freely.

518
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:33,095
"He that overcometh shall
inherit all things,

519
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:35,546
"and I will be his God

520
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,390
"and he shall be my son."

521
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,040
Hello?

522
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,781
Is it really you?

523
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:13,195
Who is this?

524
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,944
Bonsoir, Elliot.
