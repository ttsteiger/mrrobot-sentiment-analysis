1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,289
_

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,710
You guys are acting like

3
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,569
we're walking towards doomsday here.

4
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:06,670
It does say, "End of the world party."

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,496
- He's dead.
- Did anyone see you?

6
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,070
We started a movement!

7
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,804
Get back on a terminal now!

8
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,094
We need to find someone who can do that

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,229
migration thing he keep talking about.

10
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:17,497
You play chess?

11
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:18,965
I'm looking for a good adversary.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,452
Sharon, how do you not
blow your brains out

13
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:22,554
being married to him?

14
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,680
Do you want to go have a drink?

15
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:24,968
We're not to be seen together

16
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:27,062
You've been parked in the
lot for the past two days.

17
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:28,093
How long have you been asleep?

18
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,725
There she is... a ray of sunshine

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,427
in the dark void of my existence.

20
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,929
Washington Township toxic waste scandal.

21
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,717
You want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

22
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,043
and throw it at the
strongest conglomerate

23
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:40,335
in the history of civilization.

24
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,765
Jim and Saul were both
in the room with Colby

25
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,567
covering up the leak in your hometown.

26
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:48,303
Their lives will be destroyed.

27
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:53,708
The minute you remove emotion from this,

28
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:55,143
you'll do just fine.

29
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,968
Trick-or-treat?

30
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:38,306
Found it in a 99¢ shop in Chinatown.

31
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,874
I didn't know they actually made a mask

32
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,509
from that movie, did you?

33
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,179
When'd you get back to the city?

34
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,617
Well, it's Halloween.

35
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,286
Seeing as though that
used to be our thing,

36
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,787
I thought I'd hit you up.

37
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,926
"Great, Darlene, haven't seen
you in a long time either.

38
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,761
I'd love to hang out."

39
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:04,265
Next time you should call first.

40
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,134
I'm going out.

41
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,635
Come on.

42
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,337
You don't go out.

43
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,441
I don't mean that in a cunty way.

44
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:15,677
I just mean, you know,

45
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,612
you're you.

46
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,916
Look, if this is you
needing a place to stay,

47
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:23,151
then you can crash on the couch.

48
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,519
Init 1.

49
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:31,392
I wouldn't say that if I
wasn't being serious.

50
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,529
Please.

51
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,999
Hang out with me tonight.

52
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,801
For real. I need this.

53
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,517
Do you have to wear that grody old mask?

54
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,020
- It's totally nasty.
- It's father's.

55
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,622
He wore it on his yacht
five New Years ago.

56
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,624
We were a mile off Catalina?

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,394
Duh, it was the night uncle
Conrad threw himself overboard.

58
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,162
All because Dad got the business.

59
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,031
Boo-hoo.

60
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,166
I mean, clearly what the film is
doing is debunking the notion

61
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:15,136
that American society is classless.

62
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,705
Meritocracy my ass.

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,341
Long live the oligarchy!

64
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,010
Whatever, can you just
take the mask off?

65
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,144
It's freaking me out.

66
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,979
God.

67
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,181
It's like us and the three
seeders are the only idiots

68
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:30,385
to actually watch this thing growing up.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,719
This is definitely the root

70
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,255
of all our psychological dysfunction.

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,524
- Fashionably late.
- Screw that.

72
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,594
I hate our friends.

73
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,531
You still having them?

74
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:47,035
Why is that always your go-to with me?

75
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,203
I mean, trust me, in this day and age,

76
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,273
it's sicker not having panic attacks.

77
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:55,176
Since when did pretending
everything's okay

78
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,945
suddenly become the almighty norm?

79
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,183
I can write you a check.

80
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:09,290
Okay, I don't normally say this,

81
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:13,227
but I have got to Instagram this.

82
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,463
People need to know this movie exists.

83
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,275
I'm really into papadam these days.

84
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,478
What about you? You want to do Indian?

85
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,081
I hacked Postmates' proxy
that supports the APN

86
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,283
for my boyfriend's cell carrier.

87
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,386
Now it does a URL rewrite and
sends every postmates.com

88
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,088
request to my affiliate link,

89
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:42,590
meaning I get $10 coupons

90
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,859
every time a sucker orders anything.

91
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,232
What's your deal?

92
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:54,836
That lame infosec gig
scared you straight?

93
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,672
No, man.

94
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,207
Got fired.

95
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,214
Now I'm seeing a shrink.

96
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,818
Hold the fuck up.

97
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,454
What does a shrink have to do with this?

98
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:18,326
I was on this project, pen testing.

99
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:22,697
Kept finding holes in the system.

100
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:26,767
Wasn't my fault they
sucked, but it was my job

101
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:30,505
to keep hacking till
it was hacker-proof.

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,143
I think it was the night
of Memorial Day weekend.

103
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:39,380
Everybody wanted to go home...

104
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,650
to their parties, their clubs,

105
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,852
their vacations.

106
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,991
But they couldn't.

107
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,628
Because of me.

108
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,630
So when they couldn't
lock down the servers

109
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,966
they decided to lock
down my ass instead,

110
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:01,536
in the server room.

111
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:07,074
After a few hours, I fell asleep.

112
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,344
Woke up.

113
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:18,819
All the servers in the
room were destroyed.

114
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,955
I didn't remember doing it.

115
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,892
Judge made me go to therapy

116
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,862
for anger management.

117
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,941
Guess it's official.

118
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,913
I'm crazy.

119
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,352
You want to know who's crazy?

120
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:54,855
Those Wall Street psychos.

121
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,359
Okay? You'll find something better.

122
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:01,629
Angela's trying to hook me
up with a job at Allsafe.

123
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,905
You see Mom?

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,642
Not really. You?

125
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,811
Fuck no.

126
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,680
She still shits on Dad
every time I talk to her.

127
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,458
I wish I remembered him better.

128
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,134
You want to see something?

129
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,153
Holy shit.

130
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,588
Is this...

131
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:07,628
Put it on.

132
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:08,963
Put it on.

133
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,712
Oh, yeah... okay, wait.

134
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,483
Put this on too.

135
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,354
Why?

136
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,356
Because I asked you to.

137
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:19,700
Maybe I should take the job at Allsafe.

138
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,669
I could be a Trojan horse.

139
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,576
Be a good way to take them down.

140
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,844
Who?

141
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:37,451
Evil Corp.

142
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,690
Okay.

143
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,963
I can't tell if you're
joking behind that mask.

144
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,971
With the right access,

145
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:59,740
install the right malware...

146
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,079
Trash their backups,

147
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:08,816
we could corrupt all their data.

148
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,652
I bet it wouldn't even be that hard.

149
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,320
No.

150
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,490
No, the hard part would be after,

151
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,325
during the fallout.

152
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,494
That's the key.

153
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,596
The follow through.

154
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,499
They'd have an opportunity to reset,

155
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,334
rebuild their database.

156
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,470
We couldn't let them.

157
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,940
It'd be tempting to lay
off them afterwards,

158
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,943
but that's when you
have to go in for more.

159
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,611
The public's confidence in them

160
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,747
would have to be completely destroyed

161
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,116
in order to really finish them off.

162
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,957
That's the only way it would work.

163
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,929
Dude, you're freaking me out.

164
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,333
I mean, don't get me wrong.

165
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,668
Taking them down would...

166
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,036
Change the world.

167
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:12,680
Is this something you've
actually thought about?

168
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,906
You there?

170
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,357
God.

171
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:40,494
I will never understand
why you did this.

172
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,465
Asking for help was never
Darlene's strong suit.

173
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,034
But then again, is it anyone's?

174
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,269
An admission of weakness.

175
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,872
But you can't avoid the simple truth.

176
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,874
The only way to patch a vulnerability

177
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,676
is by exposing it first.

178
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,379
It's good for me here.

179
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:02,282
Better than back at my place.

180
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:03,951
It's cool.

181
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,220
I mean, I don't get it,

182
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,022
but I don't have to.

183
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,191
The flip side being that
exposing a vulnerability

184
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,560
leaves you open for an exploit.

185
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,965
I have to tell you something.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
It's pretty fucking metal though,

187
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:23,037
and I don't know if you're
gonna be able to deal

188
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:26,040
after the whole Gideon thing.

189
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,510
I know what you've been doing, Darlene.

190
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,046
I see the news.

191
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,248
That's not even the half of it.

192
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,316
You need to stop.

193
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:39,420
It's too dangerous.

194
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:41,689
Don't give me that.

195
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,557
The things we're doing, Elliot...

196
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,026
the things I'm doing to
complete our mission...

197
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,228
you'd be proud if you only knew.

198
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,864
We have something big planned
for the bailout vote in D.C.

199
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,167
No.

200
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,535
No more.

201
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,672
We're on the other side of something

202
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,874
we never signed up for.

203
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,546
My boss was killed.

204
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,848
I mean, what did you guys expect

205
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,551
was gonna happen, exactly?

206
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,720
You thought everything was
gonna be hunky-fucking-dory?

207
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:15,556
They'd go quietly into the night?

208
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,859
You said it yourself
before we even started.

209
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:23,230
The hard part would be after,
not the during or before.

210
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,571
That wasn't me.

211
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,708
That was him.

212
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,818
Well, then maybe I need him right now,

213
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:47,888
because what I'm seeing in front of me

214
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,724
isn't helping.

215
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,827
She's not telling me something.

216
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,462
She wants my help,

217
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,232
but she's not being honest about what.

218
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,334
This is what she does.

219
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,337
I mean, the things
we're doing, Elliot...

220
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:04,671
This is her default.

221
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,248
All right, I'm gonna show you
something in here first.

222
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,586
Found it kind of curious
he only printed out

223
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:22,289
a few pages of the FBI roster.

224
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,158
Turned out there was a name on each page

225
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,794
from the New York office, including me.

226
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,195
Common thread among them

227
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,997
was that we all interviewed
Gideon Goddard.

228
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,532
Still don't know what it means.

229
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,470
They were definitely stealing power.

230
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,506
They found a cable running
from a municipal power source.

231
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,108
We're still looking into Internet.

232
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,984
The whole party was on social media.

233
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,956
You really like this place for our guys?

234
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,458
An arcade with the goddamn sign outside?

235
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,694
They're hackers. Brazen.

236
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,163
They believe in hiding in plain sight.

237
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,798
This is just...

238
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,134
too stupid.

239
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,402
Well, what does that say about us, then,

240
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,103
that we're just now finding it?

241
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,842
We're bringing in all the
people from these photos,

242
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,177
cross-checking all social
media, Facebook, Twitter.

243
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,213
So they threw a party. So what?

244
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,480
Everyone threw one of these

245
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,549
"end of the world" parties that night.

246
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,051
What about the flyer?

247
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,553
We checked on the DJ name, Mobley.

248
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,555
Appears to be a DJ out in Vegas.

249
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,891
Just your average,
middle-of-the-road player.

250
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,693
Nobody of note.

251
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,728
He was doing a show out there
at Caesar's that night.

252
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,997
It checks. I'm not sure
of the connection.

253
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,233
Why don't you just break
it down for us, Dom?

254
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,202
What hard evidence do
we actually have here?

255
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,542
Found this tucked behind

256
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,244
that "Mallard Murder" game over there.

257
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,449
How do you know no one followed you?

258
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,851
They think I'm in a yoga class.

259
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:58,887
Trust me.

260
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:02,389
He's very good at this.

261
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,124
This is no way to live.

262
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,226
They keep asking me questions,

263
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,061
over and over.

264
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,796
They don't stop coming back.

265
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,366
I promise you. You're safe.

266
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,967
I don't feel it.

267
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,302
I don't feel it.

268
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,237
I should have never agreed to this.

269
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:20,741
Kareem, tell me what
this is really about.

270
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,643
I've paid you well every week.

271
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:25,545
What good is that to
me if I'm dead, huh?

272
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,314
Look what happened to the Allsafe guy.

273
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,416
They could kill me too!

274
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:31,418
I should have never got
mixed up with you.

275
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:34,187
I should have just came
clean from the jump.

276
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,297
My husband will return soon,

277
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,299
and this will all be over.

278
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,800
Listen.

279
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,802
I'ma keep telling your story, all right?

280
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,071
But if shit goes down and I get busted,

281
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,406
I'm not gonna get locked up.

282
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,107
You feel me?

283
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:57,010
They lowered the daily
allowance to 50 bucks a day.

284
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,313
That's no way to live; I
can't live like that.

285
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,253
Speak.

286
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,747
Ma'am, we're running low on funds.

287
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:47,294
I don't know how much
longer we can afford.

288
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,029
E Corp still hasn't
released your husband's

289
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,564
severance package.

290
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,866
The FBI was specifically told not

291
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,134
to put a hold on any of that money...

292
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:57,371
It's not the FBI, ma'am.

293
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,173
We can't afford to keep this guy quiet.

294
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,911
I'm done with this topic.

295
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:22,936
I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.

296
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:26,907
I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.

297
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:34,037
I dissolve all false messages.

298
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:37,073
I dissolve all false messages.

299
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:46,583
My beliefs create my own reality.

300
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:50,453
My beliefs create my own reality.

301
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:59,629
All of my dreams are
coming true right now.

302
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,966
All of my dreams are
coming true right now.

303
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:18,783
Hmm.

304
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,952
Not gonna lie.

305
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,521
You could use some practice.

306
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:39,569
Your move.

307
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:46,209
You know the definition of insanity?

308
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,845
He clearly doesn't know
who he's talking to.

309
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,348
Rather than repeating your mistakes,

310
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:55,285
you should develop your game a bit.

311
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,187
And you're gonna teach me?

312
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:59,456
No.

313
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:01,524
You are.

314
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,792
Take the board.

315
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:04,461
Play yourself.

316
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:05,895
Practice.

317
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,664
Who knows, you might beat yourself.

318
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,803
What's the point of that?

319
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,808
Because there's something on your mind.

320
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:22,178
It's been there since I first met you.

321
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:23,913
What?

322
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:26,016
Like I was behind the
biggest hack in the world,

323
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,550
which also led to the death of my...

324
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:31,021
I can tell you thinking
about it right now.

325
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:32,756
And it burdens you.

326
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,325
No shit, it burdens me.

327
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,761
But I'm trapped by it, aren't I?

328
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:44,901
Look, I'm no Catholic, but I
do believe in confession.

329
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:49,005
I've done some dark shit myself,

330
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,609
and it took real...

331
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:53,843
cleansing

332
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:56,579
to get me through it.

333
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:59,382
I can help, if you want.

334
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:05,121
What you say to me stays here.

335
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,759
Talking doesn't really help me.

336
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:16,199
You can't keep the talking
just in your head, bro.

337
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:20,070
At some point, you got to
try to make sense of it.

338
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:22,272
What if I do tell him

339
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:25,141
everything about what I did?

340
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:28,278
Krista doesn't even know that much.

341
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:32,048
What if I could talk
to someone about this?

342
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,950
Maybe he's right.

343
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,885
Maybe it could help.

344
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,587
Finally unburden me from...

345
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,289
You tell him anything,

346
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:41,591
and I will personally find the
tallest building in the city

347
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:42,792
and swan dive off of it.

348
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,894
Ray has a point.

349
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,796
I can't hold this in any longer.

350
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:48,298
It's eating away at me.

351
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,100
You confess, he goes to the law.

352
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:51,935
So what?

353
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,637
I'm okay with being on the hook.

354
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,473
I'll own it all.

355
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:57,941
And maybe it'll even stop Darlene

356
00:23:57,976 --> 00:24:00,310
from doing any more crazy shit.

357
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,312
At this rate, she's gonna
end up just like Gideon...

358
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:03,980
What do you think the
Dark Army's gonna do

359
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,349
with the knowledge that
you're all turncoats?

360
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:07,617
There's no play here.

361
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:08,852
You want to unburden yourself?

362
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,286
Go jerk off.

363
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:12,288
This... it's just a road paved

364
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:14,691
with your dead friends and family.

365
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:22,432
You need that game a lot
more than I thought.

366
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,801
Jim Chutney, SVP of B.A.,

367
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,136
and Saul Weinberg,

368
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,004
managing director of operations,

369
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,707
were arrested in broad daylight
at the E Corp offices.

370
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:32,142
Both men...

371
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:35,545
Guys like this, they work in long games.

372
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,814
I gave you information he gave me,

373
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,983
and the next day you had
these guys arrested,

374
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:41,818
which means at every move,

375
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:44,954
he has followed through on
exactly what he's offered.

376
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,490
He's given me everything I wanted.

377
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,627
I have a nice apartment, a nice job.

378
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,328
He had no leverage against me before,

379
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:55,131
so he created it.

380
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,133
So you're saying everything
he's been doing is

381
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,169
so that he can use it against you?

382
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:02,906
What about all that stuff you
said about them valuing you?

383
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:04,474
You're the one that
thought it was suspicious

384
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,075
that they offered me a
job in the first place.

385
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:08,878
I am giving you an explanation.

386
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:10,380
He's trying to negotiate.

387
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:13,049
If he's creating leverage,

388
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,552
it means that he needs
something from me.

389
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:22,225
The drafts of the settlement
negotiations... did you pull them?

390
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,927
Let's look at them together.

391
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:26,262
There might be something in
there that we're missing.

392
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:27,764
I don't trust those scam artists

393
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,766
at E Corp's risk management division

394
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:31,868
any more than you do, so I
can assure you if there

395
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:34,070
is something suspicious, our
attorneys would have...

396
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,972
I'm the thing that's missing.

397
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:40,985
There's something about
me in that agreement.

398
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,821
That's why they haven't found it.

399
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:51,681
You want to settle this
thing once and for all?

400
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,316
Hmm?

401
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,995
One game.

402
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,799
I'll even let you have the first move.

403
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,868
A game to end all games

404
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,205
between us.

405
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,974
We play,

406
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:23,813
and the winner takes all.

407
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,717
Winner takes all of what?

408
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,355
Us.

409
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,725
You win, you can confess

410
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,827
to the JFK assassination for all I care.

411
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,630
I'll leave and never come back.

412
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:47,336
What would happen if I lose?

413
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,206
You lose,

414
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,408
I get to be in charge

415
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,844
once and for all,

416
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,679
and you?

417
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,650
What about me?

418
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,657
Remember the night of the hack?

419
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,394
Remember what happened to you?

420
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,563
All I remember is, I woke
up in Tyrell Wellick's car

421
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,067
three days later.

422
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,569
And what happened in those three days?

423
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:27,109
I don't know.

424
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,878
That's what.

425
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,985
The absence of knowing.

426
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,722
Losing time forever.

427
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:44,460
A deep, black void

428
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:48,798
that you will never come back from.

429
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,266
No thoughts.

430
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,434
No body.

431
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,436
No memories.

432
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,873
Absolute nothingness.

433
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,647
You're serious?

434
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,983
You think I want this, Elliot?

435
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,453
This futile battle we're in?

436
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,489
Two halves at perpetual war?

437
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:20,496
I want peace just as much as you do.

438
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:23,432
Since we can't seem to
find any common ground...

439
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,770
Let's play for it.

440
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,610
What are you thinking about?

441
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,714
I'm thinking about his offer.

442
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:47,156
Is he the only person you interact with?

443
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,291
Don't worry.

444
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,794
You're safe.

445
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,062
Yes.

446
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,134
Elliot...

447
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,870
do you think I could talk to him?

448
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,538
No.

449
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:04,540
Why not?

450
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:06,976
It would legitimize him.

451
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,516
At this point, I think we
have to accept the fact

452
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,819
that he is a legitimate
existence in your life.

453
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,488
That's giving him too much power.

454
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,890
In order for us to figure this out,

455
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,158
we have to acknowledge...

456
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,727
What do you want from me?

457
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:28,497
You know everything.

458
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:33,068
You want me to keep repeating myself?

459
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,339
You want me to tell you
that I see my dead father?

460
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,742
That I talk to him?

461
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,844
That sometimes I lose time?

462
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,379
That there are gaps in my life

463
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,181
where I don't know what happened?

464
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,683
That I'm losing my mind?

465
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:50,920
That I didn't even
recognize my own sister?

466
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,255
That I don't know how
to control this thing?

467
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,757
I don't know how to stop it?

468
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,958
Fine!

469
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,235
Yeah.

470
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,503
Fine.

471
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,138
I acknowledge it.

472
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,412
But let's move on to the part
where you actually help me.

473
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:23,619
This game you are agreeing
to is dangerous, Elliot.

474
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:29,683
You are agreeing to destroy
a part of yourself,

475
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,819
win or lose,

476
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,721
so yes, this matters

477
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:37,491
a great deal, actually.

478
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:39,560
For better or worse, he is a part of you

479
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:43,864
that makes you you.

480
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:46,600
Annihilation is not the answer.

481
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:50,471
Krista's wrong.

482
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:54,008
Annihilation is always the answer.

483
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:57,011
We destroy parts of ourselves every day.

484
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,713
We Photoshop our warts away.

485
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:02,316
We edit the parts we
hate about ourselves,

486
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:05,019
modify the parts we think people hate.

487
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:06,887
We curate our identity,

488
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,690
carve it, distill it.

489
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:11,759
Krista's wrong.

490
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:14,094
Annihilation is all we are.

491
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,597
I fail to see the logic.

492
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:19,600
Why put all your faith in her
when we have other options?

493
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,068
Yes, yes.

494
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:25,105
We could blow up the whole
Western Hemisphere,

495
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:27,274
but you know me.

496
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:28,575
I'm old-fashioned.

497
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:31,078
I always opt for the simpler path.

498
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:33,881
Occam's razor and all that.

499
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,950
Be that as it may, it is a slower path,

500
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,719
and time is of the essence, Phillip.

501
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,721
I want to remind you
that closing the plant

502
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:42,756
is not an option.

503
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,563
And how many minutes have you allotted

504
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:52,066
for this phone call?

505
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,368
I didn't start this game.

506
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:56,970
You did.

507
00:31:57,006 --> 00:31:59,273
I'm being pressured to resign.

508
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,475
Confidence in the market
is at an all-time low,

509
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,544
and what are you up to?

510
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,780
You're not doing anything
on your end to help.

511
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:08,782
I'm handling this.

512
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:11,418
Just like I said I would.

513
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:13,587
Have you spoken to the administration?

514
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:16,156
Mm-mm, we're not there yet.

515
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:18,492
President isn't desperate enough.

516
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:20,894
We need the pressure
to cook a little more.

517
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,631
You assured me that the UN
vote would be in full swing.

518
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,568
You're the time master.

519
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:32,172
You should know that while
Rome may have burned in a day,

520
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,175
it wasn't built in one.

521
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:39,646
This will take time,

522
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:41,815
painful as that is for you to hear.

523
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,242
_

524
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:47,320
_

525
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:50,851
_

526
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:55,805
_

527
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:00,804
_

528
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,851
_

529
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:07,586
_

530
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:13,211
_

531
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:22,422
_

532
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:32,890
_

533
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:35,878
_

534
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,261
_

535
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:18,409
Hello, Scott.

536
00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:20,845
Why the fuck are you in my home?

537
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,184
Your housekeeper let me in.

538
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,072
There seems to be a problem with
my husband's severance package.

539
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,943
That sounds like an issue for HR.

540
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,211
Yes.

541
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,480
I've spoken to them already.

542
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,282
Several times, in fact.

543
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,752
They claim they can't release it yet.

544
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:52,456
Yeah, there seems to be
a problem for me, too.

545
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,630
I can't seem to find the
person who murdered my wife.

546
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:05,202
Bureaucracy is a bitch, right?

547
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,574
You want my husband.

548
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,610
I can understand that.

549
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,246
And I would like the money I'm owed.

550
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:19,249
So why don't we help each other, then?

551
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,851
I'll testify my husband didn't come home

552
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,454
the night of the murder.

553
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,155
I left the party alone...

554
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:29,860
didn't see him till the next day.

555
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,696
I'll agree to that if you
release the severance package.

556
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,505
I need that money.

557
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,073
I have a baby.

558
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,724
Tyrell Wellick's baby
gets what it deserves.

559
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,529
Nothing.

560
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,287
Whoa!

561
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:06,123
- Look out!
- What the hell?

562
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:39,756
Give me your phone, or I'm walking.

563
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,058
Jesus fucking Christ.

564
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,926
Phone, now!

565
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:50,267
Go two blocks up and
into The Looking Glass.

566
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,324
Such an asshole.

567
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,993
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

568
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,461
What the hell are you talking about?

569
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,496
No one's following me.

570
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,230
The FBI found your arcade.

571
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,003
That doesn't make sense.

572
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,038
- How'd they even know...
- I don't know.

573
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,472
Maybe it has something to do

574
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:31,174
with the dead hacker they
found the other day?

575
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,377
Yeah, I know about that, too.

576
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,125
Okay, you got to tell me,
and tell me right now.

577
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,827
Is this Dark Army?

578
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:53,697
Look, I can promise you from
the communications I've seen

579
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,867
that it's just... it's
no way that it's them.

580
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,669
There's just nothing in it for 'em.

581
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:04,908
What's Elliot say about all this?

582
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,544
He doesn't know about Romero.

583
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,746
He's in a fragile state.

584
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,415
We're past fragile, okay?

585
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,884
This shit that we're in
has fucking shattered

586
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:17,187
into a million little pieces.

587
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,256
You got to tell him.

588
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:27,631
What are you doing here?

589
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:36,039
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

590
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,341
Oh.

591
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,177
Well, I am the fucking opposite of okay,

592
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,079
so tough shit.

593
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,783
Hey...

594
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,752
You want to help?

595
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,755
Be a man and let me be upset, okay?

596
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:26,890
There's more.

597
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:31,728
Our contacts found out that
Romero was researching the FBI

598
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,798
when he got killed.

599
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,433
You know you're still inside me, right?

600
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:39,770
You got to understand, Darlene.

601
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,738
It doesn't look good.

602
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,106
The FBI is involved.

603
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:45,509
It's making the Dark Army nervous.

604
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,144
They think somebody flipped.

605
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,779
Okay, get it together, dude.

606
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,415
No one fucking talked to the FBI.

607
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,617
You can tell your pals
to eat a dick, okay?

608
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,152
Now get off already.

609
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,521
Don't be this stupid.

610
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,589
They found your spot.

611
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,857
The spot is fine.

612
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,125
We did a full wipe-down.

613
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:03,527
They won't find anything.

614
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:06,029
Yeah, well, they have something,

615
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,598
and Romero must have found out about it.

616
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,667
He had a printout with a roster

617
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,469
of FBI agents on something

618
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:15,439
called Operation Berenstain.

619
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,943
And it looked top secret,

620
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,145
possibly heavy surveillance.

621
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,454
Shit.

622
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:35,859
Okay, what? What?

623
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,828
So that's it then?

624
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,463
They know us? We're under surveillance?

625
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,198
No, no, no. I'm not saying that.

626
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:45,869
I got to leave the city.

627
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,137
Wait, hold on.

628
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,672
If you or anyone in your crew takes off,

629
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,307
that's one way to ensure you get killed.

630
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,842
That will make you look guilty,

631
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,310
and we know the Dark
Army's blanket rule:

632
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,579
they think the FBI's
even snooping around,

633
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:56,847
and it gets ugly.

634
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,150
So just stop being a hard-ass for once,

635
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,719
and just let me help you.

636
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:13,997
How the fuck did this happen?

637
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,367
You seriously asking that?

638
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,436
Do I need to remind you what you did?

639
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,368
They called it the Good Samaritan Law

640
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,002
on the account, like,

641
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:29,337
you supposed to be helping people

642
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:30,538
if they're in trouble.

643
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:32,240
Like it was your duty and whatnot,

644
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:36,177
and if you didn't then you get arrested.

645
00:42:36,614 --> 00:42:39,982
But yo, not only did the
homies do jack shit,

646
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,817
they also laughed at this fat dude

647
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,352
while he was getting mugged,

648
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,288
and I ain't gonna lie...
that was fucked up,

649
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,523
but it was pretty funny, though.

650
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:57,166
You staring at this thing.
You want to play?

651
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:02,305
No.

652
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,274
It's not for you.

653
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,310
So who's it for then?

654
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:12,815
Nobody.

655
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,052
You know, back in the
Age of Enlightenment,

656
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:17,687
motherfuckers used chess

657
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:21,057
as a means of self-improvement,

658
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:24,293
'cause there wasn't no Tony
Robbins DVDs back then.

659
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,196
This was it.

660
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,732
So what you playing for then?

661
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:32,735
If there's no who, then what's the what?

662
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,070
What's it for?

663
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:39,041
Existence.

664
00:43:45,283 --> 00:43:46,749
Dope.

665
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,852
Some high stakes right there.

666
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,356
So what you waiting on?

667
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:54,623
What?

668
00:43:57,528 --> 00:44:00,830
Do you dream, Elliot?

669
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:02,531
You scraping so hard

670
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,033
like you ain't ever asked
yourself this before.

671
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:07,770
I said, do you want
to be here right now?

672
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,405
And I don't mean, like, here-here,

673
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,242
but I mean here in a cosmic sense, bro.

674
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:17,413
Like, existence could be beautiful,

675
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:22,251
or it could be ugly, but that's on you.

676
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:32,294
How do I know which one's for me?

677
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,864
Dream.

678
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:38,901
You got to find out the
future you're fighting for.

679
00:44:38,936 --> 00:44:40,803
Sometimes you got to close your eyes

680
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:44,940
and really envision that shit, bro.

681
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:47,443
If you like it, then it's beautiful.

682
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:49,912
If you don't?

683
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:52,748
Then you might as well fade
the fuck out right now.

684
00:44:58,623 --> 00:45:00,790
You, me, in Madrid,

685
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,893
walking down Calle Atocha,

686
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:07,596
sitting in Café Rollerie
having a cortado.

687
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:11,834
I have some friends who have
a vineyard on the coast.

688
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:13,636
They would love you.

689
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:15,671
Oh, during the harvest,
everyone goes there.

690
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:19,508
It's beautiful that time of the year.

691
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:23,145
What's wrong?

692
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:27,483
Was it something I said?

693
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:30,853
Madrid.

694
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:33,989
Do you really think
you'll ever afford...

695
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:37,793
you'll ever afford that?

696
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:40,963
Well, maybe not now,

697
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:43,132
but, like... hey,

698
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,367
once I get my DJ career going, like,

699
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:46,635
a lot of times

700
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:50,873
they give you free trips.

701
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:53,476
Like, for the jobs, and I...

702
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:57,480
I can take you.

703
00:45:57,515 --> 00:45:59,682
Derek, do you know why I'm with you?

704
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:09,558
Why I'm dating you?

705
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:12,128
You're a bartender.

706
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:15,564
You make $15 an hour.

707
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,969
You're never gonna be able
to take me to Madrid.

708
00:46:20,004 --> 00:46:22,905
You're never gonna be able to
afford to take me anywhere.

709
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:29,345
You won't be able to give me
anything I want out of life.

710
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:36,519
But I've had all those things before,

711
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:40,422
and they never made me happy.

712
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:44,527
That's why I love you.

713
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:48,898
You're not any of that.

714
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:51,967
And I don't need you to be
anything more than you are.

715
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:09,518
If I do close my eyes,

716
00:47:09,554 --> 00:47:13,722
what is it that I
picture years from now?

717
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:16,225
Like Leon said,

718
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,761
doesn't one need to understand that

719
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:22,398
before they're ready to
fight for their existence?

720
00:47:25,836 --> 00:47:29,071
How would my future fairy tale unfold?

721
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:40,115
Will I finally connect with
those I deeply care for?

722
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,493
Will I reunite with old
friends long gone?

723
00:47:57,835 --> 00:48:00,836
See the ones I love find true happiness?

724
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:19,321
Maybe this future includes people

725
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:22,524
I'd never dream of getting close to.

726
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:34,370
Even make amends with those
I have unfairly wronged.

727
00:48:58,362 --> 00:49:01,063
A future that's not so lonely.

728
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:11,407
A future filled with friends and family.

729
00:49:33,698 --> 00:49:35,397
You'd even be there.

730
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,286
The world I've always wanted.

731
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:02,958
And you know what?

732
00:50:02,993 --> 00:50:06,328
I would like very much to fight for it.

733
00:50:20,086 --> 00:50:23,922
In chess, help isn't allowed.

734
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:27,326
That's the beauty of the game.

735
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:29,299
You're locked into a set of moves

736
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:32,343
as determined by your
previous choices...

737
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:40,634
Your options dramatically
changing with every decision.

738
00:50:40,669 --> 00:50:43,136
There is no lifeline.

739
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:46,273
There is no external force at play.

740
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:50,010
It is a pure battle of two opponents,

741
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:52,779
or in this case,

742
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:54,448
one.

743
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:58,051
Stalemate.

744
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,156
Again.

745
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,158
We need a winner. Let's reset.

746
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:15,068
Remember when you first
taught me how to code?

747
00:51:16,105 --> 00:51:18,572
Not really.

748
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:22,042
It was a computer chess game.

749
00:51:22,077 --> 00:51:24,344
You always told me you had
to know more moves ahead

750
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,346
than the player or user.

751
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:29,182
Sounds like good advice
from a good father.

752
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:31,551
Except for one thing.

753
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:34,488
You're not my father.

754
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,523
You're not even here right now.

755
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:46,333
Another stalemate.

756
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:49,670
What are the odds?

757
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:51,104
Let's reset.

758
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:59,713
Doesn't it make you sick
that while you're here,

759
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,348
battling me, there are people out there,

760
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,250
hurting everyone we care about?

761
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,585
Everyone's hurting because of us.

762
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:07,688
We are running around in circles.

763
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,423
This will be the last
time that we do it.

764
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,892
Been thinking about
what you said earlier.

765
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:13,293
You can think all the moves you want,

766
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,395
but at the end of the day,

767
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:16,897
the moves that I'm making are the ones

768
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,799
you're telling me to make.

769
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,600
He's right.

770
00:52:20,636 --> 00:52:23,303
There over 9 million
different possible positions

771
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,238
after three chess moves each.

772
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:28,809
There are over 288 billion
different possible positions

773
00:52:28,844 --> 00:52:30,143
after four moves.

774
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,778
The number of 40-move games

775
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,747
is greater than the number of electrons

776
00:52:33,782 --> 00:52:36,083
in the observable universe.

777
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:38,652
You don't need to know those outcomes.

778
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:41,922
You just need to be able to
see ahead of your opponent.

779
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,261
But how can you when your
other opponent is...

780
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,466
you?

781
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:58,605
Stalemate.

782
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,008
Three in a row.

783
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:03,276
The odds of that are...

784
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,845
Impossible.

785
00:53:06,615 --> 00:53:08,014
Go again?

786
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,723
I can't beat you.

787
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:21,561
And you can't beat me.

788
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:30,370
We could play again, but...

789
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:33,039
we will always be at this impasse.

790
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:40,981
And you knew all along.

791
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,653
It was the only way to
show you that fighting me

792
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:50,657
is a waste of time.

793
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,359
No.

794
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:55,829
No, we'll go again. I can beat you.

795
00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:58,198
I can beat you.

796
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:04,137
When will you finally realize
that I'm here for a reason?

797
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,376
This is avoidance!

798
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:12,045
Our fight for that future that you want

799
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,580
isn't with me at chess!

800
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:16,016
It's what you do out there with them.

801
00:54:18,187 --> 00:54:21,755
I want to be here, Elliot.

802
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,423
With you.

803
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:43,443
I want an office on the 20th floor.

804
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:46,613
I want Melissa's job, and
it's non-negotiable.

805
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,091
Go on.

806
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:01,127
I saw the pattern.

807
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:03,129
In every version of the settlement draft

808
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:05,599
for the Washington Township suit,

809
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:09,436
there was one small point that
your team wouldn't agree on.

810
00:55:09,471 --> 00:55:13,740
It remained the same, even
from the original case:

811
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:17,544
That a third-party company
must perform inspections

812
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:20,547
on the Washington Township plant.

813
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:23,717
You continue to give up power
on all these other provisions

814
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:27,320
that appear to be a lot more
expensive and important,

815
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:31,291
all in an attempt to drop
this one small point.

816
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,494
I know why you had those guys arrested

817
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,830
and why you gave me this job.

818
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:38,999
You want me to convince the class

819
00:55:39,034 --> 00:55:41,234
to remove the contingency,

820
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,103
and I'm willing to do all of that,

821
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:46,506
because you're gonna give me

822
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,174
exactly what I want in return.

823
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:59,386
Those are my terms.

824
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,961
I must say,

825
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,830
you are very impressive.

826
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:19,673
But I'm sorry, my dear.

827
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:24,210
This is all in your head.

828
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:26,513
Now, don't take that as a slight.

829
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,385
Always good to have dreams.

830
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:37,490
Wait.

831
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:45,031
I'm not wrong.

832
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:51,738
Go home.

833
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:14,761
Fuck.

834
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,100
Do you remember the first command

835
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:24,070
you ever taught me, and my
computer kept crashing?

836
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:25,839
It was init 1.

837
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:28,241
That became our thing, and I
am telling you right now,

838
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:29,709
I am fucking crashing, man,

839
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:33,046
and so are you, and I need your help.

840
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:35,615
I need you to get on the
same channel we used to.

841
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,852
I wouldn't ask you this if
it wasn't life or death.

842
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:41,121
Okay? We're in trouble
this time, Elliot.

843
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:42,156
All of us.

844
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:43,757
I have no access here.

845
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,458
It's not as if I'm gonna
go back to my place.

846
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,726
Well, it needs to happen ASAP,

847
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:48,862
so figure something out.

848
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:51,064
We might be owned.

849
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,699
What?

850
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:54,067
Why?

851
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:56,102
Well, I don't know, but we need to.

852
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:03,643
Elliot?

853
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:05,512
God, Elliot, say something.

854
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,686
Did you mean what you said?

855
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:20,460
That you wanted him, not me?

856
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:28,101
Did you mean it, Darlene?

857
00:58:28,136 --> 00:58:31,771
I need to know.

858
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,840
I want you.

859
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,775
Only you.

860
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,452
Don't worry.

861
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:47,020
I know what to do.

862
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:50,824
Why are we back here?

863
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:52,325
You cannot do this.

864
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,760
You cannot confess.

865
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:54,994
This won't save her.

866
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,362
They're gonna destroy her.

867
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,738
Who won?

868
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:10,176
No one.

869
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:32,065
What else can I do you for?

870
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,834
You tell him anything, and it's suicide.

871
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:38,037
I am pleading with you, Elliot,
just walk away from this, now.

872
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:40,140
I'm here to...

873
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,842
to help you with that computer problem

874
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:45,445
you've been having.

875
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:56,089
I would ask what made
you change your mind,

876
00:59:56,124 --> 00:59:59,225
but I'ma quit while I'm ahead.

877
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:01,361
Hey.

878
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,596
Yeah, get in here.

879
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:17,744
Did you know...

880
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:21,548
that Moses heard voices too?

881
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:26,352
Abraham,

882
01:00:26,388 --> 01:00:28,388
John,

883
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:30,390
Paul,

884
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:33,293
Jesus.

885
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:37,730
In fact, many prophets
confessed to hearing voices.

886
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:40,300
People like you...

887
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:44,370
what you have...

888
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:48,308
it can be divinity,
Elliot, if you let it.

889
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:23,276
This is what the last IT
guys told me I needed to do.

890
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:30,984
This looks like it's just
a simple site migration.

891
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:33,086
As long as one of us understands.

892
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:37,457
I got this.

893
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,534
Elliot, before you get started,

894
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:52,772
something you should know.

895
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:57,510
My online business is
very important to me.

896
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:00,813
I'm like you. I'm a private guy.

897
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:02,382
I prefer discretion.

898
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:08,655
So I'm asking you to help me

899
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,890
with the task at hand

900
01:02:10,925 --> 01:02:13,192
and not to look where you don't need to.

901
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:27,573
Why is he here?

902
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:29,142
You need help,

903
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:30,743
something goes wrong...

904
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:32,979
Lone Star will be here.

905
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,915
He's got my number and can get
in touch with me right away.

906
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:48,094
Thank you again.

907
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:58,771
I know.

908
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:00,673
I know.

909
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:04,777
This is really scratching
that part of my brain again,

910
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:08,314
but that's the part of my brain
I need to start ignoring.

911
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:32,839
What's Darlene saying?

912
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:43,483
The FBI.

913
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:47,553
They found the arcade.

914
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,523
There might be a surveillance program.

915
01:03:55,797 --> 01:03:57,663
Romero's dead.

916
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:07,940
What do you think?

917
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:10,076
Is Ray right?

918
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,578
Should I listen to the voice?

919
01:04:12,614 --> 01:04:15,348
Does it make me special?

920
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:19,185
Like Moses?

921
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,621
I don't have many options.

922
01:04:21,656 --> 01:04:23,823
My sister's in trouble.

923
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:27,760
Someone's closing in on us,
and at least for her sake,

924
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:31,664
I have to find out what they know.

925
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:35,468
Maybe this is how I fight
for that future I want.

926
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:42,008
What exactly are you doing?

927
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:45,745
I'm hacking the FBI.
