1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,625
What is it about society that
disappoints you so much?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,543
Sometimes I dream of saving the world,
saving everyone from the invisible hand,

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,780
the one that controls us every
day without us knowing it.

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:20,251
What if this all went away?
The city, the money, all of it?

5
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,387
Hey, kiddo.

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,623
Exciting time in the world
right now, exciting time.

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,525
Tell me about your father.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,694
He had leukemia, made me
swear to never tell anyone.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,963
Finally I got so worried, I told my mom.

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,798
I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,101
and he shoved me so hard I
fell backwards out the window.

12
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,970
I was eight years old.

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,806
If you don't take this deal,
you'll become like me,

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,775
losing everyone's respect.

15
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,410
I gave up everything for this case.

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,246
- I don't want you to.
- I'm not working there.

17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,315
They killed my mother.

18
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:55,253
If you want to change things,
perhaps you should try from within.

19
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,989
And I'm gonna erase
all the debts we owe.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,493
Every record of every credit card, loan,
and mortgage will be wiped clean.

21
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,295
What do we all do now?

22
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,931
Guys, this isn't about
what we'll do tomorrow.

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,935
This is about what we did.
They're free because of us.

24
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,270
Jesus, what did I do?

25
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,006
I told you we shouldn't have done this.

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,641
I'm a little concerned for Tyrell

27
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,312
because he was acting very
strange last I saw him.

28
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:27,314
I know you're behind it,
fsociety, the server, Colby, Allsafe.

29
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,921
You're one constant in
a sea of variables.

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,657
No matter what anyone tries
to do, I will never leave.

31
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,126
I will always be right here.
Do you understand that?

32
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,262
They're gonna try and get rid of me
again, and I need you to not let them.

33
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:43,801
Listen to me. I will never leave you.
I will never leave you alone again.

34
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:49,905
I am Mr. Robot.

35
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:54,779
I've always told you we'd end up
working together, Elliot, but still

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,815
I have to know, why did you do it?

37
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,648
I wanted to save the world.

38
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,742
_

39
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,080
Why this mask?
It's a bit silly, isn't it?

40
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,857
Wellick.

41
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,893
I see.

42
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,845
I understand.

43
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:50,036
James, yes.

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,004
Yes, I'm aware of Mr. Goddard's request,

45
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,441
but it needs to be removed this moment.

46
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,476
Can you escalate it?

47
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,048
Thank you, James.

48
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,801
It should be ready.

49
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,787
What is it?

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,789
It's happening.

51
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:09,247
It's almost as if...

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,249
something's come alive.

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,040
- Oh, my God.
- This is your fault!

54
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,876
- It's your fault!
- I'm sorry!

55
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,279
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

56
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,713
What did you do, you son of a bitch?

57
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,315
- He's bleeding!
- It was an accident.

58
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,150
God says there are no accidents!

59
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,285
Son, son, please talk to me.
Talk to me please.

60
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,020
God help us, he's bleeding.

61
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,021
The neighbors are looking.
This is embarrassing.

62
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,289
Son, son, wake up. Wake up!

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,957
God, is he okay? Ask if he's okay!

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,659
Can't you see he's not
responding, Magda?

65
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,028
- It's your fault, it's your fault!
- It was an accident.

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,663
God says there are no accidents.

67
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,032
I'm so sorry. Please call an ambulance!

68
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,569
Call an ambulance!

69
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,811
As you can see by the images,
everything appears to be normal,

70
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,546
which is good news

71
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,148
because there were no lesions

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,516
from the scan,

73
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,252
no hemorrhaging or bleeding,

74
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,722
mild concussion, a few stitches.

75
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,492
The forearm, however, is broken,

76
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,494
so that will require a cast.

77
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,763
- How much will that be?
- Excuse me?

78
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,498
How much will the co-pay be?

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,200
Well, that's something

80
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,668
you need to discuss with
the billing department.

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,537
- We'll talk about that later...
- Shut up.

82
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,272
You've lost your job.

83
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,074
We have no money.

84
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,675
How are we supposed to pay for this

85
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,110
on top of all your other bills?

86
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,079
Don't touch me.

87
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,448
I told you, there won't be any bills.

88
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,117
Mr. and Mrs. Alderson, please,

89
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,721
I'm going to have to ask you
to step outside for a second.

90
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,590
I'd like to talk to Elliot alone.

91
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,571
Elliot.

92
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,772
Elliot, I want you to know

93
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,875
that you are going to be just fine.

94
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,412
Now, that was quite a
spill you took today,

95
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,216
but I promise, you have a long
and healthy life ahead of you.

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,985
Now, Elliot, there are
just a few questions

97
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,453
that I need to ask you.

98
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,364
Time to get up.

99
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,806
Today started just like yesterday

100
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,842
and the day before that
and the day before that

101
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,478
and every day for the last month,

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,514
a loop, my perfectly constructed loop.

103
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,017
This is going to be
affecting our economy

104
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,519
in ways that are
extraordinarily significant.

105
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,356
The FBI announced today,
and we can confirm,

106
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,124
that Tyrell Wellick

107
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,661
and fsociety engaged in this attack.

108
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,864
They caused a lot of damage,
and we will respond.

109
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,033
We will respond proportionally,

110
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,670
and we will respond in a place
and time that we choose.

111
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,305
That's not something
that I will announce

112
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,340
at a press conference.

113
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,580
At 8:00 a.m. my daily program

114
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,982
begins by having breakfast
with my friend, Leon.

115
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,517
There's this one episode

116
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,486
where they go to this
Chinese restaurant,

117
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,390
and they're just waiting for
a table the entire time.

118
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,558
Like, they don't even
eat at the end, bro.

119
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,594
He just discovered "Seinfeld."

120
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,262
Maybe I'm overthinking it, though.

121
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,664
And talks way too much about it.

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,032
It's really fucking with him.

123
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,834
It's really fucking with me.

124
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,736
But it's perfect for me.

125
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,339
I don't have to say anything.
I can just listen.

126
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,174
God, man, that Kramer dude,

127
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,010
if I knew him in real life,
I'd knock his ass out.

128
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,847
At 10:00 a.m. I help
out around the house.

129
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,049
More broadly, though,
this points to the need

130
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,786
for us to work with the
international community

131
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,254
to start setting up

132
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,423
some very clear rules of the road.

133
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,259
Right now it's sort of the Wild West.

134
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,095
At 12:00 p.m. I have lunch with Leon.

135
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,863
And then there's this one

136
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,533
where they're stuck in a
garage the whole time.

137
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,767
Like, what?

138
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,402
That's not a TV show, bro.

139
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,770
Like, where's the story?

140
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,806
It just makes no sense.

141
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,845
At 2:00 p.m. we'll check
out a basketball game.

142
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,984
Hot Carla, the local
pyro, is usually there.

143
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,422
She's become like my personal totem.

144
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,663
Whoo, three points, bitch.

145
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,799
I still don't understand
why people like sports.

146
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,336
They get so emotional
over the weirdest things.

147
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,772
But I do see the beauty in the rules,

148
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,241
the invisible code of chaos hiding

149
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,311
behind the menacing face of order.

150
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,117
At 4:30 p.m. I clean up
around the house again.

151
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,589
There hasn't been anything
like this in the past.

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,525
That's part of what makes
this issue of cybersecurity

153
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,793
so urgent.

154
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,127
At 6:00 p.m.

155
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,762
I have dinner with Leon.

156
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,531
Though maybe I just

157
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,266
need to make peace with it,
you know what I'm saying?

158
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,702
As you can tell, we eat
most meals together.

159
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,937
Like, maybe that's the show's point,

160
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,506
that shit is just pointless, you know?

161
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,376
Like, life, love,

162
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,412
and the meanings therein.

163
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,617
I'll tell you, the human condition

164
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,220
is a straight-up tragedy, cuz. Word.

165
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,523
Like I said, I never have to talk,

166
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,992
and the repetition is good for me now.

167
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,128
It keeps my regimen intact.

168
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,898
Two days a week I go to a church group.

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,733
I don't get the rules here either,

170
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,968
but I need to keep socializing myself.

171
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,403
It's good for me.

172
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,338
Besides, these people seem normal.

173
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,909
- Amen.
- Amen.

174
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,077
Do not get into a pattern

175
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,515
in which you are intimidated by
these kind of criminal attacks.

176
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,151
America knows how to solve problems,

177
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,588
and when we work together,
we can't be stopped.

178
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,658
A new future is ready to be written.

179
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,928
I've been keeping a journal.

180
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,696
It's the only way to keep my program

181
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,566
running like it's supposed to.

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,073
See you in the morning.

183
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,575
And then I go to bed.

184
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,244
My mom has no computer
or Internet access

185
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,581
to tempt me into the night.

186
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,217
All that's left for me is
just ordinary analog sleep

187
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,919
ending the day's loop.

188
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,621
You might not think it's a way to live,

189
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,023
but why not?

190
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,024
Repeating the same tasks each day

191
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,026
without ever having to think about them,

192
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,762
isn't that what everybody does?

193
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,632
Keep things on repeat

194
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,869
to go along with their "NCISes"

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,239
and Lexapro.

196
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:53,277
Isn't that where it's comfortable?

197
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,312
In the sameness?

198
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,323
Why your mom?

199
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,026
Why her specifically?

200
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,598
She's the strictest person I know.

201
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,934
But you've attributed a lot
of your childhood trauma...

202
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,636
Better the devil you know than the devil

203
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,472
you don't, right?

204
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,014
Do you feel alone?

205
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,888
Darlene comes by sometimes.

206
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,895
Is there anything you
miss about your old life?

207
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,601
It doesn't matter even if I did.

208
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,504
Why would you say that?

209
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,877
'Cause I can't trust myself back there.

210
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,546
Why do you think you
can't trust yourself?

211
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,027
I'd like you to respond
to my question, please.

212
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,466
Elliot, it took a lot for me

213
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,669
to talk to you after what you did,

214
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,504
but I agreed with the condition

215
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,574
that you were going to
be more open with me.

216
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,176
I was very clear when we discussed...

217
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,212
It's not that I don't trust myself.

218
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,367
I don't trust him.

219
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,168
Hello again.

220
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,870
Yes, I'm talking to you this time.

221
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,207
I'm sure you wanted to hear
what I told Krista back there,

222
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,342
but I'm not ready to trust you yet,

223
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,277
not after what you did.

224
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,047
You kept things from
me, and I don't know

225
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,617
if I can tell you secrets like before.

226
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,919
Friends are supposed to be
honest with each other,

227
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,721
and you weren't.

228
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,723
It's gonna take a while to
rebuild this relation...

229
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,759
Talking to your friend again?

230
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,801
I thought we were done with all that.

231
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,036
Here.

232
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,073
Check that out.

233
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,942
Lots of nicer friends in there for you.

234
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,088
We can't stay here.

235
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,990
There's more work to be done.

236
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,492
Our revolution needs a leader,

237
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,427
and what are we doing instead?

238
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,664
Journaling.

239
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,334
Che Guevara is throwing up
in his grave right now.

240
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,106
You think this is gonna get rid of me?

241
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,976
I am not to be gotten rid of.

242
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,111
This zombie act you're pulling?

243
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,779
It don't work on us.

244
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:20,250
This control you think you have?

245
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,287
It's an illusion.

246
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:29,026
You want my attention?

247
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,829
Tell me what I want to know.

248
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,132
Tell me where Tyrell is.

249
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,134
I can't do that.

250
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,605
Then go fu...

251
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,460
Are you done?

252
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,847
What's next on this roller coaster

253
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,483
of a regimen, needle-pointing?

254
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,542
It is not hyperbole to say

255
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,411
we're in a grave financial situation.

256
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,080
All of this cautionary
sentiment out there,

257
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,082
it's not just Wall Street hoopla.

258
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,752
The more I talk about it, the
more terrified I become.

259
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,088
Fortuntately, the original
plan that was put in place

260
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,090
was ineffective.

261
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,760
Most experts agree that
this is not just a crisis,

262
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,761
but a very dire one.

263
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,798
Something absolutely needs to be done.

264
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,436
Even though the European Union has been
denying that it could affect them,

265
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,105
this week we saw that they were wrong.

266
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,708
The banks cannot lend money
that they don't have

267
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,543
so the economy is at a standstill.

268
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,633
And I'm just the messenger.
I am telling you, folks,

269
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,936
this is what they don't
want you to hear,

270
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,638
because a union strike on
the Comet natural gas plant

271
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,041
will cause an energy shortage the likes

272
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,977
of which has never been
seen in the northeast.

273
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,713
Without literal power
we will have no power.

274
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,215
This is part of a strategy

275
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,150
to declare economic war on this country,

276
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,153
and they know it, they know
exactly what they are doing,

277
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,222
and 2015 will be known as
the year that America,

278
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,957
this great nation,

279
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,193
swapped democracy for dictatorship.

280
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,390
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

281
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,594
On television blabbing on and on and on,

282
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,129
telling people... lying to them.

283
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,231
Instead, bring honesty...

284
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,099
somebody who can explain it best.

285
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,237
because this "crisis" is happening.

286
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,838
Hello? Hello?

287
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,909
Why don't you tell your viewers

288
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,744
about the Weimar Republic?

289
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,182
Because the similarities
between them are disturbing.

290
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,020
Meaning the end of the
world as we know it.

291
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,660
Tyranny in the streets.

292
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,097
- Hello?
- Hello?

293
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,535
- Hello?
- Hello.

294
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,504
That's right.

295
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,209
Stop!

296
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,007
Well, what am I supposed to do?

297
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,209
I mean, nothing is working.

298
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:29,651
Unplug what?

299
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:33,155
Everything is inside the walls.

300
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,590
That's how it was installed

301
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,592
when I ordered the smart house package.

302
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:41,096
Now the alarm is going
off, and it's freezing.

303
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:44,433
It's below 40.

304
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:46,735
I have a place in Greenwich,

305
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,605
but you don't expect me to...

306
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,008
How long is it gonna take
before this all gets fixed?

307
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:43,659
The tracking on her phone is working,

308
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:47,963
and she's headed north as we speak.

309
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:51,033
How long you think she's
gonna stay away for?

310
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,868
Long enough.

311
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:10,218
The collective result of these attacks

312
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:12,854
could be a cyber Pearl Harbor,

313
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,825
physical destruction
and the loss of life,

314
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,028
and create a new, profound sense

315
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,564
of vulnerability.

316
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,036
As director of the CIA and
Secretary of Defense,

317
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:32,240
I have understood that cyber attacks...

318
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,276
I hope you don't mind I came.

319
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:45,153
Something wrong?

320
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:52,127
It's good to see you, Gideon.

321
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:54,196
You, too.

322
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:57,232
I know we didn't leave
things on the best of terms.

323
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:03,138
Is it true? What I heard about Allsafe?

324
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:07,109
Oh, there is no Allsafe.

325
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:10,112
I've had to furlough everyone.

326
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:12,481
I'm hoping to get up and running again,

327
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:15,917
but everyone's telling me it's over.

328
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,153
Gee, I wonder whose fault that is.

329
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,955
Was that you or me?

330
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,325
Getting all mixed up, I can't recall.

331
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,294
Let me get to my point.

332
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,264
The FBI believes that
I was behind the hack

333
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,334
or complicit in some way.

334
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,236
I've given them all the evidence I can.

335
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,139
I've cooperated every step of the way,

336
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:39,674
but they still keep coming at me.

337
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,844
They don't trust me.

338
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,447
In fact, I think they might
be hacking my email.

339
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:47,415
I know someone is.

340
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:52,020
And now you're wondering who
that someone is, aren't you?

341
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,123
There are logins from times and
machines I don't recognize.

342
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,927
Because if it was me, then
that means it was you.

343
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:00,662
How about it, huh?

344
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:03,598
Could you live with yourself
knowing that you framed Gideon?

345
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,133
I keep changing the password,

346
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,469
but it still hap...

347
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:09,504
Elliot?

348
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,377
- What's wrong?
- Go ahead, tell him.

349
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,213
Tell him that you're slowly
descending into madness.

350
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,282
- Stop.
- What? Stop what?

351
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:21,316
There are only so many times

352
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,651
before my bullets finally

353
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,553
penetrate that thick skull of yours,

354
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,555
and as the blood trickles out,

355
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,057
so goes any sense of reason.

356
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,559
Round and round we go,

357
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:33,862
you not knowing what
you did or didn't do,

358
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:37,299
our infinite loop of insanity.

359
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,801
If you know anything at all,

360
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:43,872
or if there's anything
you can do to help me...

361
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:50,045
I need you to.

362
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,014
I can't help you.

363
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,251
Are you really gonna let him
take the fall for this?

364
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:59,688
Look at him, a scared, small animal.

365
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:04,226
Well, that's... that's unacceptable.

366
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:07,262
Now he's doing what all small
animals do when they're scared,

367
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,264
pretend they're bigger and scarier.

368
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,000
Look, if you're not gonna
do anything about this,

369
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:13,335
I'm afraid you've left me no choice

370
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,204
but to go to them with what I know,

371
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,241
which, given the things I
know about the day you left,

372
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,509
it's pretty damning.

373
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:25,547
Now, I'm asking you one last time

374
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:27,449
to do the right thing.

375
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:29,451
He does have a point.

376
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:32,954
He does know a lot, perhaps too much.

377
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,625
I wonder if I slashed
open his neck right now,

378
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,760
would it be me doing it,
or would it be you?

379
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:41,463
- No.
- Yes.

380
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:44,966
I am going to go to them.

381
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,468
I'm going to tell them everything.

382
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:49,070
Do you understand, Elliot? Everything.

383
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,907
Truth is, though, right,
it doesn't matter.

384
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:53,608
You start adding up all the choices

385
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:55,810
you've been making, they
all add up to one thing.

386
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,480
You add up to one thing...

387
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:00,515
me.

388
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:04,953
What's going on over there?

389
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,122
I'm not gonna lie, Gideon got to me,

390
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:43,925
but now is when I need
the regimen the most.

391
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:57,138
After all, that's the whole
reason for the routine,

392
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:58,873
to stay as sane as possible

393
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,442
until he's gone,

394
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,977
and once he's gone,

395
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,145
I can finally be the real me again.

396
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,181
No, not just that it's pointless,

397
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,549
but maybe

398
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:08,984
it just means nothing, you know?

399
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:13,989
Like Costanza says, a
cold, random universe.

400
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:20,996
Bro, what's up with the...

401
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:22,597
Nothing, man.

402
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,068
Gideon's gonna rat you out.

403
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,674
He probably already has.

404
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,180
Hey, you can't ignore this.

405
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,616
They have eyes on you.

406
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:43,351
This is how they work you.

407
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:46,654
I'm not gonna change my mind.

408
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,656
I'm sticking to my regimen.

409
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,760
Hey, I am not some tumor to be excised,

410
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:54,329
do you understand? The opposite.

411
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:57,499
I'm the organ vital to your existence.

412
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:59,401
Now, if you insist on keeping this up,

413
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:02,270
I'm gonna go from annoyed
to hurt, and, kiddo,

414
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:05,774
trust me, you do not want
to hurt my feelings.

415
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:13,415
How do I take off a mask
when it stops being a mask,

416
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,919
when it's as much a part of me as I am?

417
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,056
We keep fighting.

418
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:23,258
Like the world we unmasked,

419
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,428
we will find our true selves again.

420
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,431
Maybe after wiping away
the thick, grimy film

421
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,066
of Facebook friend requests

422
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,600
and Vine stars

423
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,737
we can all see the light of day.

424
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:37,872
I know we haven't talked in a while.

425
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:40,075
Maybe you only trust me about as much

426
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,110
as I trust you right now,

427
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:45,713
but I'm gonna ask you to
have hope for me anyway.

428
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:50,952
Just, please, have hope.

429
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,107
I'm gonna take a selfie.
I'm gonna take a selfie.

430
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,142
You guys ready?

431
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:17,145
Yeah!

432
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,616
- We got the balls!
- Whoo!

433
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:49,077
Whoo!

434
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,045
We got the balls!

435
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:08,396
Give me your phone.

436
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:12,800
- Why? I didn't post any...
- Give me your phone.

437
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:31,486
Ahh!

438
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,336
We are in a war,

439
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:52,106
and we are on the losing side of it.

440
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:54,876
We are on our knees
with guns to our heads,

441
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:58,913
and they are picking us off one by one.

442
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,590
Susan Jacobs,

443
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:12,927
the general counsel at E Corp.

444
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,195
You want to know what her nickname is

445
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,464
inside the company?

446
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:20,435
Madam Executioner,

447
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,540
not just because she could kill
any lawsuit filed against them,

448
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:30,979
but because those lawsuits
usually involved deaths.

449
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:34,949
These are the cowards
we are dealing with.

450
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:42,957
We have been on our knees for too long,

451
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:45,994
and it's time to stand up.

452
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,301
Make it a four-hour SDR if necessary.

453
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,403
Take surveillance detection stops.

454
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,171
Go into pharmacies. Run errands.

455
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,806
Disrupt data points.

456
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:01,976
No one takes the same
route back here twice.

457
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:04,812
I don't want anyone
burning this location.

458
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,025
Where is everyone else?

459
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Don't know.

460
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:23,364
They were always half in.

461
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,837
What... what you're doing here,
Darlene, and what you're saying?

462
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,274
I mean, you sounded like George W. Bush,

463
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,642
for crying out loud.

464
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:37,612
Okay, first of all, that's low.

465
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:40,848
Secondly, give me some credit.

466
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:43,951
The speech is bullshit, but it works.

467
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,021
- It riles them up.
- Yeah, to what end though?

468
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,856
You know, sawing off balls,

469
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:52,293
making protest signs?
We were more than that.

470
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:54,295
I mean, we... you know, we
accomplished something.

471
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:55,963
We... we took them down.

472
00:33:55,999 --> 00:34:00,034
Then why does it feel like
they're still winning?

473
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,872
That what we did made
it worse, not better?

474
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,711
You know I'm right.

475
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:12,246
We didn't finish them off.

476
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,582
That's all there is to it.

477
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:17,018
People everywhere came out
to support us mobiley,

478
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:20,488
and right now they need to
know we haven't given up,

479
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:25,393
that we meant what we said
about changing the world.

480
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:57,125
Don't be half in like the others.

481
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,463
This thing we started, it
deserves more than that.

482
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:18,946
Have you, uh, have you seen Elliot?

483
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:22,450
That's not important.

484
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:25,720
This is everything right now.

485
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:34,462
Absolutely unfair, madam,
absolutely unfair.

486
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:35,830
We were done with our payments.

487
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,598
Ma'am, we are doing our best here.

488
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,301
At this moment we cannot verify
that you paid all your payments.

489
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:42,136
Absolutely ridiculous. I have.

490
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:43,337
I have all my bills right here.

491
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:44,972
I was never late on one,

492
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:46,408
and I also have copies of
the checks that I sent...

493
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,242
People have been forging paper records.

494
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,511
We haven't set up a system to
verify these sorts of claims.

495
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:52,980
It took me three weeks to get
this appointment, madam.

496
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:54,782
Now you're telling me you can't help me?

497
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,684
What kind of business is this?

498
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,920
I've been responsible
for the last 20 years

499
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,288
in paying off my home.

500
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:01,989
Where's your accountability?

501
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,425
Yet, if the tables were turned,

502
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,693
you would have kicked
me out of my own house.

503
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:08,162
You know what? Cancel my account.

504
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:10,331
I'm done doing business with you crooks.

505
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:11,766
You deserve what you're getting.

506
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,334
Ma'am, I can't say

507
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,036
for sure we can give you all your money

508
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,504
if you close right now.

509
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,005
Unbelievable.

510
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,307
I know what I have.

511
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:22,143
I just want to cancel.

512
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,335
It's on my computer too.

513
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,605
I have the IT guy helping me right now.

514
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:26,341
Sorry I'm late.

515
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,376
I was coming from my place in Greenwich.

516
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:34,048
I was on the phone with
the FBI all night.

517
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,183
We can't confirm the sender,

518
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,553
but the email we received is authentic,

519
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,289
more than likely the same hackers

520
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,057
from the ransomware.

521
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,093
Unbelievable.

522
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,196
What are their demands, again?

523
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,432
$5.9 million.

524
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:55,069
$5.9 million

525
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:57,138
to be delivered to Battery Park City,

526
00:37:57,173 --> 00:38:00,942
9:00 p.m. tonight, no police.

527
00:38:00,977 --> 00:38:05,313
If we want to pay the ransom,
the FBI will not sanction it.

528
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:08,916
We cannot negotiate with these people.

529
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,651
Our techs are looking into it.

530
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,254
We'll find a way to decrypt
it and get the system...

531
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,756
How long?

532
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:18,326
Five days, tops.

533
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,829
Five days for our banking
system to be down?

534
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,397
That's a lot of money down the drain.

535
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,933
I don't even want to mention the optics.

536
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,569
We can't afford this hack right now,

537
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,339
and frankly, I think we
can find $5.9 million

538
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:32,607
in between our couch cushions.

539
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:34,241
It's nothing.

540
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:38,980
My opinion as general
counsel is to pay it.

541
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:43,684
What's this other request they made?

542
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,654
"You must send one of your chiefs

543
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:49,190
and no one else?"

544
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:52,693
I think they meant one
of our chief officers.

545
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,831
This is a joke.

546
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:59,934
Did they really expect one
of us to go out there, hmm?

547
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,802
What are we talking about here?
These people

548
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,972
are terrorists, pure and simple.

549
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,675
Unfortunately, I have to
agree with Scott on this.

550
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,777
It's risky.

551
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:12,313
We have no idea what these
guys are capable of.

552
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:15,683
So you think we should pay the ransom,

553
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,952
but you don't want any of us to do it?

554
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:21,355
We can get one of our security
officers to go undercover.

555
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:23,791
Yes, and risk all of this
blowing up in our faces.

556
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:27,395
No.

557
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,964
If we're going to even
consider doing this,

558
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:33,300
we shouldn't give them any
reason to do more damage.

559
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,711
I'll do it.

560
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:51,519
I'm Chief Technology Officer.

561
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:53,087
I qualify.

562
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:54,522
I'll do it.

563
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:07,234
If we're gonna pay these bastards,

564
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,271
I want to be the one that faces them.

565
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:22,913
