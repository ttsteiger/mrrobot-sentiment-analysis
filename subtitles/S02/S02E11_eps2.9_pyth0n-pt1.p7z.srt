1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,735
Alexa, when is the end of the world?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,837
Unless a future technology
goes very wrong indeed,

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,371
Earth is most likely to be destroyed

4
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,840
in several billion years' time.

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,541
The president can't go to Congress

6
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,110
with a bailout right now.

7
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:14,113
I could see a scenario
where the Chinese government

8
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,515
loans E Corp the money it needs

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,084
at a low interest rate,

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,351
perhaps even zero.

11
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,751
Looks like he's opting
for his Ecoin strategy.

12
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,724
You want me to convince the class

13
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:26,425
to remove the contingency.

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,560
Your little pet project

15
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,362
came through even better
than you thought.

16
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,032
You do work at E Corp. Yes?

17
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,533
What is your position there?

18
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,601
I never said that.

19
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,969
I'm gonna confess.

20
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,570
I've already called my lawyer.

21
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,905
We can't beat them.

22
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,273
No matter what we do,

23
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,210
we will always lose to them.

24
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,078
Next person's not
gonna offer you food.

25
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,479
They're gonna grab you off the street

26
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,414
and throw you in a dark cell.

27
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,716
I've tried to have him tracked,

28
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,051
but I've been unsuccessful.

29
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,085
Got it. Is that where

30
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,253
the phone is right now?

31
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,155
Okay, okay.

32
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,090
We're gonna settle down here.

33
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,424
Hey, Elliot.

34
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,425
You can stay here

35
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,727
and crash on the couch.

36
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:03,095
Home would be better.

37
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,797
Is Mr. Robot MIA

38
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,066
because he's afraid
of what I might find?

39
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,468
Send all units to Watts and 6th Ave.

40
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:18,811
Angela's right. We can't beat them.

41
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,480
But we don't have to
lose to them either.

42
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:25,851
Maybe there's a way to
stop them from winning.

43
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:30,956
Mr. Robot, the ever-present
silent observer,

44
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,458
watching me at all times,

45
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,828
even when I can't see him,

46
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,964
listening in on our conversations.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
He's always a step ahead of me,

48
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,502
'cause he is me.

49
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,637
Maybe he's the key to this.

50
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,140
Maybe he's always been the key to this.

51
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,609
What if I could be the silent observer?

52
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,848
In middle school, I took
a Visual Basic class.

53
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,784
I remember my friend Sam
telling me about a technique

54
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,823
he used to induce lucid dreams
so he could study in his sleep.

55
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:07,726
You lie in bed and repeat
this mantra in your head:

56
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,330
Mind awake. Body asleep.

57
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,499
Mind awake. Body asleep.

58
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,302
You're in this with me,

59
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:19,205
so it'll work better
if we do it together.

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Just say it with me.

61
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,408
Mind awake.

62
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,711
Body asleep.

63
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,713
Mind awake.

64
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,681
Body asleep.

65
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,583
Mind awake.

66
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,719
Body asleep.

67
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,554
Mind awake.

68
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,489
Body asleep.

69
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,363
Mind awake.

70
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,332
Body asleep.

71
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,100
Mind awake.

72
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,869
Body asleep.

73
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,871
Mind awake.

74
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,705
Body asleep.

75
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,191
Ma'am. What do you want to do?

76
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,434
Let me see it again.

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,247
Sure this is accurate?

78
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,291
You know, of all the gifts he sent,

79
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,492
this is the greatest we ever received.

80
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,854
So you're not gonna tell
me where you're taking me?

81
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:23,162
You can't do this. I want my phone back.

82
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,983
I'm not the only one with the files.

83
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,784
You think I didn't make copies?

84
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,354
There are copies everywhere.

85
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,431
A lot of people are gonna
know that I'm missing.

86
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,523
This isn't my blood, in
case you're wondering.

87
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,091
You need to finish this evaluation.

88
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,526
I understand you have your procedure,

89
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,728
but these are extreme circumstances.

90
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,197
I believe the best use for me
is back at the crime scene.

91
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,033
We should be getting
Director Comey involved.

92
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,168
- That's how serious this is.
- You're in shock.

93
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,437
At you and the way you're
treating me right now, sure.

94
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,341
Can I speak to Agent
DiPierro for a minute?

95
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,410
Alone?

96
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,555
You know I can't leave.

97
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,229
Yes, you can.

98
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,250
You're going off the handle.

99
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,618
They're gonna force you to take leave

100
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,986
if you keep talking like that.

101
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,556
This is all your fault.

102
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,424
I told you not to release the sketch.

103
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,759
I told you Dark Army was
gonna come after him.

104
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,595
And not only are several people dead,

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,497
but I almost just got killed out there.

106
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,233
Well, that makes me feel good.

107
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,901
It's not every day I get casually blamed

108
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,236
for the deaths of innocent people.

109
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,971
Clearly, Dark Army is behind this.

110
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,740
And who knows how far up this goes?

111
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,076
The Chinese government
is definitely involved.

112
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,677
They're hiding something.

113
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,013
We need everything on lockdown.
We might have a leak.

114
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,848
And I'm serious about
what I said about Comey.

115
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,250
He needs to know.

116
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,918
This is a matter of
national security now.

117
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,686
This is no longer just
a terrorist attack.

118
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,589
This could be an act of war.

119
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,524
We should get the military involved.

120
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,327
Look...

121
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,196
I agree with you.

122
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,499
Something's going on.

123
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,033
Especially given the weird timing

124
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,202
of this $2 trillion.

125
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,171
But we can't just go off on everyone

126
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,472
without knowing all the facts.

127
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,073
What $2 trillion?

128
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,110
This morning,

129
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,779
the U.S. got back in bed with China.

130
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,314
China bailed out E Corp.

131
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,884
Gave them a $2-trillion
no-interest loan.

132
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,554
Unprecedented.

133
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,789
It's a trap.

134
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,958
Don't you get it? We
have to talk to them.

135
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,960
They can't do this after
what happened last night.

136
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,163
What, that some Mexican
restaurant got shot up?

137
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,165
It was more than
that, and you know it.

138
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,599
We have to tell them.

139
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,176
We can't let them get
away with this, Santiago.

140
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,578
They're going to get away with this.

141
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,714
$2 trillion, Dom.

142
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,417
That's the miracle the
world's been waiting for.

143
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,720
The U.S. isn't going to mess
with its Chinese relations now.

144
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,722
And with the OPR
investigation still going,

145
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,724
the bureau isn't even
getting close to it.

146
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,025
You gotta be kidding me.

147
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,527
A month ago, they tried to kill us.

148
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,896
And in politics,
that's a distant memory.

149
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,097
This deal they have now

150
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,566
is about to potentially solve

151
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,734
the biggest global crisis in history.

152
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,905
Now, look.

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm on your side.

154
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,342
I'm not saying I'm walking away.

155
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,511
I'm just saying we need to start

156
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,779
finding a way to walk
in between the mines

157
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,448
and not on them.

158
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,785
Whatever happened, whoever did this,

159
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,021
they mobilized quickly,
created a narrative,

160
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,456
and before we even knew it,

161
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,758
this was all in the rearview mirror.

162
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,028
Go home.

163
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,129
Get some rest.

164
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,803
Promise me you'll let
me do the interview.

165
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:04,000
It can wait a few hours.

166
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,777
Go rest.

167
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,617
What the fuck is going on?

168
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,084
Hello?

169
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,655
What's happening?

170
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,068
HANG IN THERE

171
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,522
We don't have much time.

172
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:54,323
Let's get started.

173
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,530
Who are you?

174
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:02,832
There's water coming
out of that fish tank.

175
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,333
We don't have much time.

176
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:06,702
Let's get started.

177
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,778
LAND OF ECODELIA
PRESS ANY KEY TO START

178
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,090
Have you ever cried during sex?

179
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,363
What's going on?

180
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,666
Have you ever cried during sex?

181
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,467
Who are you?

182
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,835
Who sent you here?

183
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,071
Please answer the question.

184
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:45,074
Have you ever cried during sex?

185
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:49,344
I'm not answering these questions.

186
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,647
If you don't answer,

187
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,049
I'll be punished.

188
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,754
They'll beat me.

189
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,234
Who's doing that to you?

190
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,009
Yes?

191
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,543
Yes.

192
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,847
Okay. Bye.

193
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,716
We really need to begin.

194
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,685
Our time is running out.

195
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,488
Have you ever cried during sex?

196
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,130
No.

197
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:47,603
Have you ever fantasized
about murdering your father?

198
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:54,276
No.

199
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,649
Are you a giraffe or a seagull?

200
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:08,223
I cannot do it. It's unconstitutional.

201
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,059
We're talking about
rolling out Ecoin loans.

202
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,761
I fail to see how the Constitution

203
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:14,764
fits into this logic.

204
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,566
Look, with Ecoin equal to one dollar,

205
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,635
it'll free up the economy.

206
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,603
It'll give you some breathing space.

207
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,338
You knew this was going to happen

208
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,141
from the get-go.

209
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,676
And you're hitting me
with this while there's

210
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:29,078
an energy crisis across
the Eastern seaboard.

211
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,914
Oh, yeah. I am coming to you first.

212
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,516
- Asking.
- Don't give me that.

213
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,018
The only reason why you're here first

214
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,753
is because you don't want to get slapped

215
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,089
with regulations.

216
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,791
But if you are indeed asking,

217
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,326
then I am saying no.

218
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,661
It's unconstitutional.

219
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,096
You can't make your own currency.

220
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,998
That is the federal government's job.

221
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:54,136
We simply cannot let you
make big loans in Ecoin

222
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,471
that you wouldn't make in dollars.

223
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,812
Jack.

224
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,883
Look at me.

225
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,057
I am not the problem here.

226
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:19,394
The problem here is,
hard cash is fading...

227
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,663
rapidly.

228
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,966
That's just the way of
the world right now.

229
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,667
And Bitcoin is spreading.

230
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,169
And if Bitcoin takes over,

231
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,839
we are all in a world of hell.

232
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,507
It is unregulated, it's already reached

233
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:34,543
its transaction volume maximum,

234
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:37,679
and it is partly controlled
by Chinese miners.

235
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,749
You just accepted $2
trillion from them.

236
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,150
Yes, yes.

237
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,686
And now I want to use it against them.

238
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,322
With Ecoin, we control the ledger

239
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,724
and the mining servers.

240
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,560
We are the authority.

241
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,328
I will make sure you have visibility

242
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,364
into every single wallet that's open,

243
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,999
every loan, every transaction,

244
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,668
which means we can start
making new assets,

245
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,005
which means we can start
rebuilding the banking sector

246
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,208
without your having to inject even more

247
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,344
politically unpalatable
federal funds into it.

248
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,013
The president will laugh in my face.

249
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,417
But he'll know this is
the right thing to do.

250
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:16,852
This is gonna be controlled

251
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,855
by a good, old-fashioned
American company.

252
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,356
You want to regulate it?

253
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,260
Be my guest. Regulate
the shit out of it.

254
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,262
I'll give you back doors,
side doors, tracing...

255
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,263
whatever you want.

256
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,965
Just don't shut it down.

257
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,573
This was always the future, Jack.

258
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,077
The Five/Nine attacks...

259
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:46,048
they just accelerated it.

260
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,951
How long?

261
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,652
How long have you been
pressing this pedal?

262
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:53,255
How long have you been
plotting against me?

263
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,225
Oh, come on, Jack.

264
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,660
We... we've known
each other for years.

265
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,162
You know full well I...

266
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,831
I don't give a shit about you.

267
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:04,233
So please,

268
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,337
don't hold a personal grudge
just because you lost.

269
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,509
Defeats can still be profitable.

270
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,317
Are you red or purple?

271
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,320
Purple.

272
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:39,662
Is the key in the room?

273
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,201
What?

274
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:47,937
Is the key in the room?

275
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:52,175
I don't know what you mean.

276
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:56,679
Is the key in the room?

277
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:57,847
I don't know.

278
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:07,356
Yes.

279
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,825
Yes.

280
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,093
Okay.

281
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,338
Hello?

282
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,906
You are standing in a dark room

283
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,708
and can't see anything.

284
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,944
There is a torch and a match.

285
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,712
What do you do?

286
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,920
I light the torch.

287
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:40,522
The torch fills the
dark room with light.

288
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,691
You see a door in front of you.

289
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,527
What do you do?

290
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:47,029
I open the door.

291
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:50,099
How do you open it?

292
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,901
I turn the knob.

293
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:57,473
The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?

294
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,076
- I don't know.
- The knob doesn't turn.

295
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:02,611
- How do you open it?
- I don't know.

296
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:04,914
The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?

297
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:07,917
- I said I don't fucking know.
- The knob doesn't turn.

298
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,719
- How do you open it?
- With a key.

299
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:13,355
I use a key. I unlock it with a key.

300
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,493
Thank you.

301
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,095
Hello?

302
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,100
What happens now?

303
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:46,289
Is the key in the room?

304
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:07,176
Yes.

305
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:15,651
The key was in my fist.

306
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:18,221
My fist was in my pocket.

307
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:27,503
READY

308
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,207
I'll be back with your results.

309
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,305
Alexa, wake me up at, um...

310
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,408
Sorry, I didn't understand

311
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,477
the question you were asking.

312
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,981
That's because I wasn't asking
a question, you dumb bitch.

313
00:23:56,654 --> 00:24:00,556
Alexa, are we friends?

314
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,658
Yes.

315
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,895
We live together.

316
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:08,630
I feel like I don't even know you.

317
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,636
Alexa, what's your favorite color?

318
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:16,638
Infrared is super pretty.

319
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:25,948
Alexa, do you have a boyfriend?

320
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,750
I'm not the dating kind.

321
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:31,820
Yeah, me too, hon.

322
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:35,124
We're a lot alike.

323
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,295
Alexa, what are the color of your eyes?

324
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,997
I don't have eyes,

325
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:43,399
but my light ring has lots of colors.

326
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:48,837
Mine are gray.

327
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,840
I think.

328
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,688
Alexa, are you happy?

329
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:09,191
I'm happy when I'm helping you.

330
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:20,036
Alexa, are you alone?

331
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:23,239
I wasn't able to understand
the question I heard.

332
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:45,361
Alexa, do you love me?

333
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,799
That's not the kind of
thing I am capable of.

334
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:03,079
Yeah.

335
00:26:33,478 --> 00:26:35,478
Alexa, good night.

336
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:41,016
Good night. Don't
let the bedbugs bite.

337
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,252
Who are you?

338
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,174
Is this your house?

339
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,378
I've been here for hours.

340
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,747
I wanted to confirm

341
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:34,381
that this wasn't a waste of my time.

342
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:37,217
- Well, what about my time?
- Oh, honey.

343
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:41,956
My time is much more
valuable than yours.

344
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,191
Speaking of, I've only allotted

345
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:46,293
28 minutes for this conversation,

346
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,596
which is very generous of me.

347
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,165
So we should begin.

348
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,569
I'd like to leave.

349
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,971
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

350
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,906
You've waited so long.

351
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:01,642
Surely you want to know why.

352
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,544
That is, if you indeed believe

353
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,614
that your time holds any value.

354
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:21,428
You've been here close to four hours,

355
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,798
and you never thought
to walk out the door.

356
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:32,673
The door was locked.

357
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:37,077
I've always found doors
fascinating inventions.

358
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:40,414
They hold the entry to
unlimited imagination.

359
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:42,617
Before you open any door,

360
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:45,520
a world filled with possibilities

361
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:46,854
sits right behind it.

362
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,357
And it isn't until you open it

363
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:52,527
they are realized.

364
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:55,329
Such potential they bring to our minds.

365
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:58,298
And yet a lock

366
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,702
stopped you from all of that.

367
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:04,805
How...

368
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:07,074
lazy.

369
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,919
Your fish died.

370
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:22,256
Yes, I know.

371
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,294
You're a terrible person.

372
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,734
You hurt that little girl.

373
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,571
Makeup.

374
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,874
It was part of the test.

375
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,141
Empathy...

376
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,578
or gullibility.

377
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:45,279
Take your pick.

378
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:50,350
Test?

379
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,720
Why were you testing me?

380
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,521
I know you have sensitive information,

381
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:56,958
and I don't want you to release it.

382
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:02,063
Normally, my associates would
have murdered you by now.

383
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,098
In fact, by my calculations,

384
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:07,401
you should have been dead 90 days ago.

385
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:11,906
But somehow, you stuck around
long past your expiration.

386
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:18,345
Who are you?

387
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,281
I am a woman of time.

388
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:24,852
And I don't believe in accidents.

389
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:28,623
You, like an annoying penny...

390
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:31,191
Keep turning up.

391
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:33,628
Everywhere I look, you're there.

392
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:36,396
That is why I wanted to meet.

393
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:39,634
So I could find out why
you are so special

394
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,103
to Phillip Price.

395
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:44,471
He's ruining our partnership,

396
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:48,442
and somehow it seems that
you're the motivation.

397
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:53,648
It's true, we have an event
and a friend in common.

398
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:56,751
But I haven't been fully
able to understand

399
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:59,987
the meaning behind it.

400
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,421
What event?

401
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:03,057
It's no coincidence

402
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:06,293
that you and Mr. Alderson
became who you are

403
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,562
after what happened with the
Washington Township plant

404
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,297
so many years ago.

405
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:19,674
What does this have to do with Elliot?

406
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:22,043
Do you know him?

407
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:26,346
If I told you that your mother

408
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:27,915
and Elliot's father...

409
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,317
Died for a reason, would
it make a difference?

410
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:32,252
That they were a trade,

411
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,021
a sacrifice for the greater good,

412
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,157
that they gave their
lives to take humanity

413
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,925
to the next level.

414
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,461
And you are both who you are
today because of that event.

415
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,097
You would be a different person.

416
00:31:43,132 --> 00:31:45,365
You wouldn't be sitting in
front of me right here.

417
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,136
You are at the
intersection of all of it.

418
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,641
So I'm not going to kill you.

419
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:56,877
But I am going to prove to you

420
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:59,446
why you need to drop this mission

421
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:03,350
that you seem so stubbornly
unable to let go of.

422
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:27,374
Look, I don't know what you want.

423
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:32,579
But I'll give you the jump drive.

424
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:35,816
Please, just let me go.

425
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:39,153
Fear.

426
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:43,457
How easy a quicksand of time
people let that become.

427
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,162
We both know that you could keep finding

428
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:49,997
the plant's data.

429
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:52,332
Like that penny that keeps turning up,

430
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,201
your silly need for justice,

431
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:56,904
revenge will rear its ugly head

432
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,672
and encourage you to keep trying

433
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:03,110
and eventually find a way
to shut down my project.

434
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:06,546
I don't want your proof.

435
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:09,583
I want your belief.

436
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,420
Belief in what?

437
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:46,153
Do you ever think that if you imagined

438
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,956
or believed in something,
it could come true...

439
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:53,627
Simply by will?

440
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:04,939
Yes.

441
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:07,942
Actually, I did believe that.

442
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:17,184
But I'm slowly having to admit

443
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,486
that's just not the real world...

444
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,293
Even if I want it to be.

445
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:37,804
Well, I guess it all depends

446
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,342
on what your definition

447
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:43,543
of real is.

448
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,688
Mind awake.

449
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:57,191
Body asleep.

450
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:59,159
Mind awake.

451
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:01,061
Body asleep.

452
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:02,897
Mind awake.

453
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:05,032
Body asleep.

454
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,301
Mind awake.

455
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,869
Body asleep.

456
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:11,005
How long have I been asleep for?

457
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,073
Body asleep.

458
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,175
Mind awake.

459
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:17,511
Body asleep.

460
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,213
Mind awake.

461
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,315
Body asleep.

462
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,317
Mind awake.

463
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:25,585
Body asleep.

464
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:34,995
Body asleep.

465
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,363
Mind awake.

466
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,266
Body asleep.

467
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:42,436
Did it work?

468
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,504
Body asleep.

469
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,506
Mind awake.

470
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,343
Body asleep.

471
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:52,846
Can he see us?

472
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:54,081
Hear us?

473
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:55,249
Hey, asshole.

474
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,392
Now I'm the silent observer, like him.

475
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:07,594
Like you.

476
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:10,230
Body asleep.

477
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,899
Mind awake.

478
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,468
Body asleep.

479
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:16,303
This is a cipher message.

480
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,572
That's why he wanted to come home.

481
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,574
Someone's trying to make contact with me

482
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:23,043
Each number represents a letter.

483
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,047
A is one. B is two. C is three.

484
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,116
You can hear him too, right?

485
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,789
Body asleep.

486
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,795
G-U-R.

487
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:58,945
G-U-R.

488
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,149
T-H-E.

489
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:05,486
A shift value of 13.

490
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,587
It's a rot-13 algorithm.

491
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:27,807
"The Perrin pages will help
you find your calling,

492
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,010
"but don't be duped.

493
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,978
"Cut down the woods.

494
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:34,748
They be Erdos."

495
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:39,948
PERRIN PAGES NUMBERS
PERRIN NUMBER

496
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,255
Number sets.

497
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:45,768
WOODS ERDOS

498
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:49,230
Where? Where?

499
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,665
Where are you?

500
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,938
APPETIZERS

501
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,339
"Cut down the woods."

502
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,309
Remove all of the Perrin
and Erdos woods numbers.

503
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,366
THE ON-LINE ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF INTEGER SEQUENCES

504
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:44,985
It's a phone number.

505
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:48,822
But to who?

506
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:58,232
25th and 8th.

507
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,501
There will be a cab waiting.

508
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:39,812
We got Bitcoin here. Bitcoin for sale.

509
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,346
We can't lose him.

510
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,315
Bitcoin for sale.

511
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,864
Anybody have Con Ed bills?

512
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,667
Con Ed bills! Anybody have Con Ed bills?

513
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,942
With Ecoin's soaring popularity,

514
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:16,079
E Corp CEO Phillip Price
announced what he is calling

515
00:40:16,115 --> 00:40:18,315
a revolutionary new loan program

516
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,017
backed by the emerging cryptocurrency.

517
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,354
Ecoin loans are being touted
as having increased benefits

518
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,489
over conventional...

519
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,157
U.S. dollar-backed loans,

520
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,758
all of which are designed to support

521
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,760
low- and middle-income borrowers.

522
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,663
What this means, as Mr.
Price has stressed,

523
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,333
is that this new loan program
will not only provide

524
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:38,668
the economy with a
much-needed jump-start

525
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,170
but, more importantly,

526
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,638
give economic relief...

527
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,374
To those most affected post-Five/Nine.

528
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,643
However, it does seem to fly in the face

529
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,478
of E Corp's... - Angela.

530
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,646
What happened to you?

531
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,314
I thought we were gonna meet.

532
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:58,121
I need you to forget about
that voice mail that I left you.

533
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:07,330
Are you in danger?

534
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:09,232
No.

535
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,171
Something is wrong. I can tell.

536
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,573
You are not telling me everything.

537
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,911
With a much-needed jump-start

538
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,381
but, more importantly,
give economic relief

539
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:27,517
to those most affected post-Five/Nine.

540
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,886
However, it does seem to fly in the face

541
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,988
of E Corp's economic policy...

542
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,391
Don't call me anymore.

543
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,317
Where did he go?

544
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,119
ONE WAY

545
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:12,028
Wait, I have to remember,

546
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,863
I'm not following him.

547
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,832
I am him.

548
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,207
What I should be asking is,

549
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,276
where am I going?

550
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,093
Elliot?

551
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,928
You Elliot?

552
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,664
How do you know my name?

553
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:56,939
No Elliot?

554
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,246
No, no, okay.

555
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:05,014
Wait.

556
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:19,829
Elliot, yes?

557
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,431
Yes.

558
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,500
Address?

559
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,105
What do you mean?

560
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,073
Address.

561
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,978
I don't know.

562
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,492
Chambers and Church.

563
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,166
We have to be careful now.

564
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:03,573
This is no longer a
question of what I'm seeing.

565
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:06,810
No, we know that's not reliable.

566
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,578
The real question is,

567
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:09,813
what am I not seeing?

568
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,014
You have to understand,

569
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,485
us two meeting right
now, it's dangerous.

570
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,055
Don't worry. We're safe.

571
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,992
Our partners have proven
to be very influential.

572
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:38,174
Do you see him?

573
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:44,080
Do you see someone sitting next to me?

574
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:51,120
Elliot, what are you doing?

575
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,490
- My apologies, sir.
- Did you hear that?

576
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,059
Hey!

577
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,028
- Do you see him?
- Elliot, stop it.

578
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,363
Did... did you hear that?

579
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,699
Hey!

580
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,200
You have to calm down!
Calm down, Elliot.

581
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,935
I need you to turn around and tell me

582
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,737
if you see someone sitting
next to me right now.

583
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,639
Just pull over, sir.

584
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,574
I'm terribly sorry. If
you could just pull over.

585
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,142
Do you see him? Hey!

586
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,911
- Shut up! No!
- Elliot!

587
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,614
I need you to turn around and tell me

588
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,982
if you see someone sitting next to me!

589
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:25,288
What was the meaning of that?

590
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,056
I know you've been
under a lot of stress,

591
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,925
but I've been under a lot of stress too.

592
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,327
Can you even begin to imagine
what it's been like for me?

593
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,165
We can't talk out here. We're exposed.

594
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,634
Let's go.

595
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:39,936
Go where?

596
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,938
Enough of these games. Now, let's go.

597
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:45,141
- We're close.
- Close to what?

598
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,545
Have you forgotten everything?

599
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,417
Dark Army told me that
stage two is ready.

600
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:57,086
When you see it, you'll be pleased.

601
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:04,994
It worked, Elliot.

602
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,830
It's up to us now.

603
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,533
Let me show you.

604
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,979
Louie, I think this is the beginning

605
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:25,348
of a beautiful friendship.
