1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,860
I need you to keep an eye on me

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,430
You're the only person I can trust.

3
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:05,340
This is
what democracy looks like!

4
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,109
Elliot,
I'm working with the FBI.

5
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,577
You've been spying on me?

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,279
The other night,
I followed you.

7
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,147
He snuck out
and met up with Angela.

8
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,517
Stage 2... I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,420
It's time Phillip Price's
hand got slapped.

10
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,455
This morning at 6:07 a.m.,

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,524
the Dark Army
tried to run Stage 2.

12
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:24,459
They're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.

13
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,295
We need to get Tyrell

14
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:27,662
before it's too late.

15
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:33,268
My wife, my son, and I
will go to the Ukraine

16
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:35,670
- after the plan is complete.
- I'll get into that.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,442
Everybody...

18
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,644
This is a zero sum game.
Accept the truth.

19
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,513
The Recovery building's
going to explode,

20
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,448
and the people inside
right along with it.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,040
Angela's the one
behind this.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,060
I gotta stop her.

23
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,680
- I got it done.
- Oh, good.

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,454
Irving, are you still gonna
evacuate the Recovery center?

25
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:53,822
That's been done already.

26
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,625
I'm Emily Moss's daughter,
Angela Moss.

27
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,161
I'm here to discuss
the Washington Township case.

28
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,830
Dad, what's going on?
I'll let you two talk.

29
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:05,500
26 employees died from
similar types of leukemia.

30
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,569
Evil Corp killed my mom,

31
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:12,341
and my whole life,
I've always wanted justice...

32
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,708
for her death.

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,660
CREDITS

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,557
I think I've seen
this one, yeah.

35
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:05,627
Elliot has these on VHS.

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,163
Is Elliot here,
Mr. Alderson?

37
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:11,533
No, he didn't...
he didn't come.

38
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,437
Why?

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,907
Well, I guess he wasn't
feeling up to it.

40
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:23,245
I don't wanna
be here, either.

41
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,149
There's a lot of
nice people visiting.

42
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:32,354
Are you sure you don't wanna
join the party?

43
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,356
We got this cake.

44
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,525
Red Velvet.

45
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,493
Not hungry.

46
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,440
You know,
if that were me over there,

47
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:52,841
I would want Elliot and Darlene

48
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:55,844
to come over and talk to me.

49
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,383
But I don't want
to talk to her.

50
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:11,393
You remember the, uh,

51
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,927
Enchantment Under the Sea dance

52
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,797
in the first
"Back to the Future" movie?

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,900
Marty had to push his dad

54
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,303
to ask Lorraine to be his date.

55
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:25,240
And if George didn't
overcome his fear,

56
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,675
they would never
have gotten married,

57
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,710
and Marty would never
have been born,

58
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,714
and he would've disappeared
from that photograph, right?

59
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,485
I guess so.

60
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,989
I know it's scary,

61
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:45,760
but I also know
that you can do it.

62
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:47,729
Just might need a little push.
That's all.

63
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:01,710
Hey, Angela,

64
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,379
somewhere down the road,

65
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:08,883
if Elliot needs some help
and...

66
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,019
I can't
be there for him...

67
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,625
Just give him
a little push too, okay?

68
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,028
Okay.

69
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,968
- You understand?
- Of course, Emily.

70
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,671
Also, I know
we discussed it before,

71
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,641
but I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't bring it up again.

72
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:36,010
It's about the anonymous
benefactor who keeps...

73
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:38,780
- I'll let you two talk.
- Don...

74
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,653
Sorry, did I say something
I shouldn't have?

75
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:47,356
Not at all.
You're fine.

76
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,359
Well, he reached out again,
offering to pay for your...

77
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,561
That's very nice of him,

78
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,596
but I've made my decision.

79
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,431
No more treatments.

80
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:57,999
I wanna spend
what time I have left

81
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,335
with my friends and family.

82
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,873
Just know that there's still
people fighting for you,

83
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,575
for your family.

84
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,009
We're gonna continue
with the lawsuit

85
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,646
and do everything we can
in your name.

86
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:37,639
Hey, you.

87
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,007
Hi.

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,776
What do you think
of the party?

89
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,445
This isn't fun.

90
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,879
It's weird.

91
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,416
Weird how?

92
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,787
It's okay.
You can say it.

93
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:55,524
- I'm dying.
- I don't want to.

94
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,991
I hate this.

95
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,993
- I hate all of it.
- Angela...

96
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,696
you know this isn't
good-bye, right?

97
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,833
No, I know what dying is.

98
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,435
You're never
gonna see us again,

99
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:09,571
- not Dad, not me...
- Mm, no, listen,

100
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:12,040
I am always gonna
be there for you,

101
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,742
no matter what.

102
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,716
You wanna know what I believe?

103
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,019
What?

104
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,459
That this isn't the end,

105
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,828
that there's another world
out there for both of us,

106
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:36,998
that we'll see
each other again.

107
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,568
And we'll play and dance

108
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:42,537
and... bake and sing.

109
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:46,007
Doesn't that sound beautiful?

110
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,982
Will you believe with me?

111
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:06,961
Angela...

112
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,630
Attention.

113
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,732
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

114
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,601
This is an emergency...

115
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:16,204
I don't know
what you're talking about.

116
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,607
I saw you.

117
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,174
The 23rd floor.

118
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,843
You were at
the code signing machine.

119
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,078
What did you do?

120
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:27,048
We need to let today happen.

121
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,051
They're blowing up
a building.

122
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,686
Yes, I know.

123
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,592
And you're okay with that?

124
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,267
How long have you been
working with Tyrell?

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,269
- What did he tell you?
- None of that matters

126
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,171
right now.

127
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:54,909
This whole time...
I thought you were helping me,

128
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,612
but you've been...

129
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,715
you've been manipulating me!

130
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,258
This is what you wanted.

131
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,694
After today,
your revolution succeeds.

132
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,830
You just need the courage
to see it through.

133
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:19,133
You sound like him.

134
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,835
You, you mean.

135
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:27,976
I need to stop this.

136
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,778
Today's work,
what White Rose is doing,

137
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,646
is going to change everything
for the better.

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,648
You met White Rose?

139
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,617
What the fuck is happening?

140
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,619
She's going to save the
world, but we need to let her.

141
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:39,320
Save the world?

142
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,223
Angela, whatever White Rose
told you is a lie.

143
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,859
She's a fucking terrorist,
and if you let this happen...

144
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,628
Then we're going to
look back

145
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,630
and see that these consequences
were necessary...

146
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:51,933
- People are going to die!
- No, they're going to be fine!

147
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:58,807
Including your father
and my mother.

148
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,813
What the fuck
are you talking about?

149
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,083
You're not making any sense.

150
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,854
Angela...

151
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,792
Listen to me.

152
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,628
Whatever you pulled
off of that machine,

153
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,730
I need you to give it to me.

154
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,131
- Now.
- I can't.

155
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,599
- I don't have it anymore.
- Where is it?

156
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,167
Who did you give it to?

157
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,871
Tell me what you know.

158
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,240
Where are they operating from?
Where's Tyrell?

159
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,309
Where the fuck is he?

160
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,758
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,

161
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,293
but are you even allowed
to be in this building?

162
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,931
I heard you were let go
this morning.

163
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:11,145
So much depends
upon a red wheelbarrow...

164
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,683
Glazed with rain water...

165
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:17,151
Beside the white chickens.

166
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,927
Should've put a wire on her.

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,730
- What did you say to him?
- What I had to.

168
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,331
Well, excuse me
for doubting you,

169
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,234
but you never struck me as
a country-first type of gal.

170
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,704
- I don't like you very much.
- Ditto.

171
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,339
What are you, six?

172
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,976
It's him.

173
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,014
Pick it up.

174
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,884
Elliot, where are you?
What's going on?

175
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,220
I texted you the address.

176
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,388
- Is that where Tyrell is?
- Yes.

177
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,957
We need confirmation.

178
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,291
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

179
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,993
Get the FBI there to stop him.

180
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,862
You gotta do it now.

181
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,297
Make him come to us.
Find out where he's headed.

182
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,034
- Where are you going?
- Just take care of Tyrell.

183
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,436
Push him.
We can keep him safe.

184
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:12,273
Elliot, just please
don't do anything stupid, okay?

185
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:13,441
- Just come meet me...
- I gotta go.

186
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:14,876
Elliot, wait.

187
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,279
Everything I said this morning

188
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,281
and everything I've done...

189
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,116
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,860
Call ended.
Got the location.

191
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,280
It's a restaurant called
Red Wheelbarrow.

192
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,091
Let's move.

193
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,026
Dom, you heard him.
He said the info was good.

194
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,395
Let's go.

195
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,865
What aren't you telling me?

196
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,099
Dom...

197
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,480
Between the rioters

198
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,210
and the police
at E Corp's headquarters,

199
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,948
I can't connect there.

200
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,483
I can't access
my back-doored machine,

201
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,218
but I need to
log in to that UPS,

202
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,519
or everything's fucked.

203
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,880
Fastest way of connecting

204
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,220
is to go into
the Recovery building myself.

205
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,058
I heard the conversation
myself.

206
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:06,127
Our CHS has confirmation.

207
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,329
- So she had eyes on him?
- No, not exactly, but...

208
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,531
The intel
seems credible, sir.

209
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,166
We gotta act
before Wellick disappears

210
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,002
for another five months.

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,142
Here's what we'll do:

212
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,777
I'll put surveillance
on the location

213
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,478
until we have
visual confirmation.

214
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,816
Surveillance?
Santiago, the lead is solid.

215
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,151
This is coming from Darlene.
This is why we have her.

216
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,086
I can't move
on the word of a CHS

217
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,189
who has basically, so far,
given us jack shit,

218
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,158
and then disappeared on us
for almost a week,

219
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,559
without so much as a word.

220
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,829
I need something more concrete.

221
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,831
If Wellick is there,
we have time.

222
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:44,365
He's not going anywhere.

223
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,334
Before we send SWAT
bashing down doors,

224
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:47,869
let me coordinate
with S.O. teams

225
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,537
to get eyes on the place.

226
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,439
Ask the S.O. ASAC
to get aviation in the air.

227
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,175
We get confirmation, we go in,
we take down Wellick.

228
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,077
Dom...

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,478
we may only get
one shot at this.

230
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,380
I wanna make sure
we do it right.

231
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,480
_

232
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,640
_

233
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,634
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

234
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,308
After all our tit-for-tat,
you finally got your U.N. vote.

235
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:04,879
Quite the frenetic day for
the 24-hour newshounds.

236
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,247
I wondered
if you'd make it today,

237
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,549
given everything
going on at E Corp.

238
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,886
An eventful morning indeed.

239
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,923
But something told me
I shouldn't miss our little...

240
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:16,991
soirée,

241
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:19,027
not for the world.

242
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,363
Speaking of my dear little,

243
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,966
wounded E Corp,

244
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,002
I'll be expecting China
to sign that economic accord.

245
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,571
All will be done
by end of day.

246
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,306
You have my word.

247
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,509
Oh...
thank God that's settled.

248
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,411
For now, let's...

249
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,480
break from
our usual brinksmanship.

250
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,349
No need to spoil
this afternoon.

251
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,918
We both won, as intended.

252
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:47,188
It's time to drink
and be merry.

253
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,656
Good point.

254
00:14:55,696 --> 00:15:00,534
Another fine choice
of venue by Sergey.

255
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:04,105
Utterly tasteless.

256
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:07,541
I passed that buffoon
of an owner in the lobby.

257
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,477
You're gonna take him up
on his offer

258
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,446
- to go boating tomorrow?
- Oh, please, don't remind me.

259
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,716
Those swim trunks
he insists upon wearing,

260
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,452
a bit too snug...

261
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:20,688
and a bit too short,
wouldn't you say?

262
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,093
Mm. I believe the appropriate
term is "hanging brain."

263
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,217
Good.

264
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,985
Good.

265
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:09,670
Sir, it's about Mr. Wellick.

266
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:13,507
Our contact says his location
has been compromised.

267
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,610
Well, that doesn't
change anything.

268
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,479
You know what to do.

269
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:30,591
Kill process:

270
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,093
when an unwanted process
is running

271
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,095
and you need to terminate it.

272
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:36,430
I need to kill Stage 2
before it kills anyone else.

273
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:38,099
Wrap it up.
False alarm.

274
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:39,500
We're outta here.

275
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,402
Back it up!
Let's go.

276
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,404
False alarm, folks.
It's safe to go back to work.

277
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,340
What are they doing?
What about my bomb threat?

278
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:48,242
False alarm.
Go ahead, go up.

279
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,749
Why is everyone
going back in?

280
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,151
Everything's fine.
False alarm.

281
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,519
No, it's not safe.

282
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,560
You gotta get them
out of there.

283
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,360
ESU swept the floor.
All's clear.

284
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,693
Uh, it's, uh...

285
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,561
It's... it's safe
to go back to work.

286
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:14,335
I called in a bomb threat
with no bomb for them to find.

287
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,737
There's no tangible explosive.

288
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,473
They had no idea
what they were looking for.

289
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,842
- But I do.
- Folks, you need E Corp I.D.

290
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,277
to re-enter the building.
Please have them out

291
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:24,478
where we can see them.

292
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,719
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

293
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,788
Have your badges out and ready.

294
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,690
Let's go. One at a time.

295
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:22,570
Can you give us a status
update on the seventh floor?

296
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,306
Seventh floor clear.
Heading back down to you.

297
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,411
I was right.

298
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,313
Angela helped them
get around my patch

299
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,915
and sign their own malware
with a cloned HSM.

300
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,351
If I can roll it back,
the clean version

301
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,686
will overwrite Tyrell
and Mr. Robot's malware

302
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,190
and buy me some time
to revoke the stolen keys.

303
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,561
A couple of minutes,
and we'll be...

304
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,234
Why can't I do this?

305
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,369
Why can't I start the restore?

306
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,440
Ohh!

307
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,740
Names are Fattie,
Fattina, and Georgie.

308
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,917
Georgie was named
after my aunt.

309
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,220
Lovely woman.
Fat fingers, though.

310
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:47,855
What the fuck is going on?

311
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,924
Anyway, it's nice to have
a customer flag me down.

312
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,395
Since 5/9, we haven't had
a whole lot of customers.

313
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,896
Hey...
Stop, stop.

314
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,465
What's the problem?

315
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:58,899
You told me
Houston on Avenue A.

316
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,735
- When did I say that?
- 20 seconds ago.

317
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,538
Mr. Robot.

318
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:08,409
I lost time. We know that.
But how much did he take?

319
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,679
15 minutes.
I can't spare 15 minutes.

320
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,547
Stop the goddamn car.

321
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,248
Pull over now!

322
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,123
If the malware's
already loaded,

323
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,158
hydrogen is filling up
the battery room right now.

324
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,827
There are too many factors

325
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,261
to predict
when it's going to blow.

326
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,997
Could be two hours,

327
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,965
or it could explode
at any second.

328
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,535
Why do we always cut
these things so damn close?

329
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,273
Agent DiPierro.

330
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,975
Tell me you have
something, Dom.

331
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,510
I am sitting here,
fucking pins and needles,

332
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,445
losing my shit.

333
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,147
You know I can't share
any information, Darlene.

334
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,082
Have you heard
anything more from Elliot?

335
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,084
No, I've been
trying to call him,

336
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,920
- but he's not answering.
- Unless you've got more intel

337
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,188
that can further this case,
I'm hanging up.

338
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,790
We gave you this lead.

339
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,525
You wouldn't have shit
without us.

340
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,962
Don't think for a second
that I don't know

341
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,463
that you're keeping
something from me.

342
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,498
Given what's at stake,

343
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,201
whoever you're protecting,

344
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,337
I sure as shit hope
they're worth it.

345
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,221
Wrong fucking day, girls.

346
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:48,008
You hungry?

347
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,943
Yeah, I could eat.

348
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,281
No, I mean,
do you wanna go get lunch?

349
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,327
I can get lunch
if you wanna get lunch.

350
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,900
I'd be up for it.

351
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,370
All right then,
I guess we're going to lunch.

352
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:35,188
I don't understand.
Why is everyone leaving?

353
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,190
They should be
monitoring the fallout.

354
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,529
Where are Joanna and my son?

355
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,631
What time is
our flight to Kiev?

356
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,239
What is this?

357
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,943
What's going on?

358
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,251
Everything's gone.

359
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,419
Motherfucker.

360
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:09,622
Is Mr. Robot gaining control,
or am I losing control?

361
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,592
If he has the power to switch,
does that mean I do too?

362
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,228
Is this a matter of
who wants to win the most?

363
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,097
Yeah, I agree,

364
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,699
this is fucking confusing.

365
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:42,622
Your trip to the Ukraine,

366
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:46,726
it's not gonna work out
the way we discussed it.

367
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,036
I've got 14 customers,

368
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,306
four cooks behind the line,
two girls working checkout.

369
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,374
No sign of Wellick.

370
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:03,510
We had a deal.

371
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,612
I... I found a solution.

372
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,016
You... you said
you'd bring my family to me.

373
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,318
- What's going on out front?
- I've got eyes on the door.

374
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,053
Nothing unusual
there or nearby.

375
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,730
You fucking promised!

376
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:26,166
The plan is happening
because of me,

377
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,401
and this is how you repay me?

378
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:35,175
I'm afraid the situation
is more nuanced than that.

379
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,319
Shit, there it is again,
his presence.

380
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,787
Do you feel it too?

381
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,392
No, I need more time.

382
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,236
At least he didn't
get too far this time.

383
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,737
Five minutes.

384
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,239
I'm narrowing the gap,
but still,

385
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,774
this isn't one of our bullshit

386
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,477
stalemate prison chess games.

387
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,415
In this case, a stalemate
means Mr. Robot wins.

388
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,252
So, this is it?

389
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,389
This is how it's going to end?

390
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,098
Bathroom's in use.
Make that 15 customers.

391
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:41,441
Follow
the instructions inside,

392
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,810
and then burn them.

393
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:47,114
Well, unless Tyrell's taking
a leak, what do you wanna do?

394
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,815
I'm gonna eat.

395
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,355
You're not going to kill me?

396
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,195
Tyrell...

397
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,404
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,645
Stay focused.
Stay focused.

399
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,251
The stronger I am,
the better chance I have of...

400
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,338
Three more minutes gone.

401
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,872
Who knows how many
I have to spare?

402
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,708
I'm running out of options.

403
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,377
Instead of fighting,
maybe it's time we talk.

404
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,848
The soda fountain's
behind you there.

405
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,817
Have a seat, and we'll call
your number when it's ready.

406
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,753
Oh, and here's
our loyalty card.

407
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,388
Ten wheelbarrows punched,

408
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,457
and you get
a free milkshake on us.

409
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,492
You know, I... I don't get
to this neighborhood too often.

410
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,294
How long have you been open?

411
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,580
_

412
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,080
A little over six weeks,
but if you're talking about

413
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,700
the grand opening special,
that's over.

414
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,344
Just curious. Thanks, hon.

415
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,400
_

416
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,920
_

417
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,762
I guess
he didn't like my note.

418
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,815
I need to get
to the battery room.

419
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,302
Enjoy your meal, ma'am.

420
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,974
I got a worker exiting now,
red apron.

421
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,743
Keep an eye on him.

422
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,312
10-4.

423
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,550
Mom, it's me.

424
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,385
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time.

425
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,953
I need you to stay home
for the rest of the day.

426
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,555
Don't go out.

427
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,559
I'll ship you some Ensure.
Just don't go...

428
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,764
I'll have it delivered today.

429
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,033
Yes, yes, they have
same-day delivery now.

430
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,802
I promise.
Just stay home.

431
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,005
I love you too.

432
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,722
So, I'm going to move in with
my oldest daughter, Louise.

433
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,925
We agreed it's best to pool
our resources these days,

434
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,362
but......
I don't wanna be a burden.

435
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,364
Don't think like that.

436
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,567
You know
it's the best thing to do.

437
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,805
And it doesn't make sense
for you to be living all alone.

438
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,840
You're probably right.

439
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,410
And my... my ulcerated colitis
is kicking in again,

440
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,011
so it'd be nice
to have family around,

441
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,881
you know,
in case anything happens.

442
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,817
You can never be too safe.

443
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,153
Did you hear about the melee
at E Corp this morning?

444
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,424
The whole world's going to hell
in a hand basket.

445
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,091
Give me your purses, now!

446
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,093
Oh!

447
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,129
Give it!

448
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,165
Ecoin wallet, where is it?

449
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,167
Please, please don't hurt me!

450
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,702
Please!

451
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,405
The fuck you waiting on?

452
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,706
Hand over your purse!

453
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,661
What's going on?
What's in there?

454
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,673
There's a fire. I've got smoke
coming from the backroom.

455
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,509
I'm looking at the floor plan
now, and there is no backroom.

456
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,717
Last time I ask bitch!

457
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,586
Do it!

458
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,155
Cred 22958 to Op Center.
Emergency transmission.

459
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,157
Go with your message, 22958.

460
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,460
I've got a fire coming from
Red Wheelbarrow restaurant,

461
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,840
1197 Broadway.

462
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,490
Notify ASAC Santiago
and 5/9 task force

463
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,233
- of a possible Wellick sighting.
- Copy that.

464
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,482
What are you doing?
Give him your purse!

465
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,222
Norm, I'm going in.
Get around to the backdoor now,

466
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,525
in case Tyrell's in there
and tries to run.

467
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,172
You could've died.

468
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,141
No.

469
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,243
No one's gonna die.

470
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,849
The battery room
has a halocarbon

471
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,817
fire suppression system.

472
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,753
If I can activate it,
it'll suck all the oxygen

473
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,387
out of the room in 30 seconds,

474
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,356
seal all the doors,
and create a vacuum,

475
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,059
making it impossible
to create any kind of spark,

476
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,293
which would prevent...

477
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,911
The kill command.

478
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,748
Here I am, trying to use it
to stop this attack

479
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,751
while Mr. Robot
is trying to use it on me.

480
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,186
Does that just mean
we cancel each other out,

481
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,990
fighting so hard,
we end up standing in place?

482
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,326
Fuck that.
I gotta keep moving.

483
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,799
Dude, you okay?

484
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,134
Yeah.

485
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,282
You disobeyed a direct order.
I told you, flat out...

486
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,384
I already told you
it was a site survey.

487
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,386
Report me if you want.

488
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,755
Then why am I standing
in a goddamn basement

489
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,758
- with the door kicked in?
- There were signs of a fire.

490
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,259
I did my job.

491
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,096
I'd do it again,
if given the opportunity.

492
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,232
Anything else?

493
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,004
All right.

494
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,939
Look...

495
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,474
despite your blatant disregard
for chain of command,

496
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,011
this was still a win.

497
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,378
Wellick was here.

498
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,480
The evidence ERT pulls
out of this shit hole

499
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:32,383
can only bring us closer
to capturing him.

500
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,319
Now, we've got task force
canvassing the tunnels.

501
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,855
If Tyrell is in there,
we'll get him.

502
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,028
Why don't you head back
to the office?

503
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,197
When the evidence comes in,
you start sorting through it.

504
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,315
I can see your big ass eye.
Open up.

505
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,751
- What do you want?
- Open the goddamn door.

506
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:34,344
- Small coffee, black.
- You got it.

507
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,079
I'm gonna head up
to the office.

508
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:39,483
- You gonna be okay?
- I'll be up in a minute.

509
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:41,351
You fucked us,

510
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,553
bent us over the sink
and went to town.

511
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,656
You're not making any sense.
We're on the same side.

512
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,762
No... Fuck!

513
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:55,565
Oh, come on, please! Fuck!

514
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,966
Fuck!

515
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,508
I saw you

516
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,676
manipulating my brother,

517
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,445
turning his condition
against him.

518
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:11,981
Taking down E Corp
was your plan. Remember?

519
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,360
_

520
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:29,766
Hey... hey!

521
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,402
No! Stop the attack!

522
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,771
You have to stop the attack!
Get on the ground!

523
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,473
- Get on the ground!
- Listen to me,

524
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:37,941
- you have to stop the attack!
- On the ground!

525
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:48,818
You're the ones
who dragged me into this.

526
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,687
We didn't ask you
to blow up a goddamn building

527
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,155
full of people.

528
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,123
You don't know
what you're talking about.

529
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:56,593
They're evacuating
the building.

530
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,940
_

531
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,720
_

532
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,208
It's gonna happen any second.

533
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:14,644
Please, listen to me,
I can help you!

534
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,846
Let's go!
Go, go, go!

535
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,649
Tell me why I shouldn't
call the FBI and turn you in.

536
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,452
What is it that
you really want, Darlene?

537
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,187
With all their paper records
consolidated there,

538
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,691
this is going to mark
the official end of E Corp.

539
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,260
_

540
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,940
Folks, get back!
Please stop.

541
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,480
_

542
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,814
You can lie to yourself
all you want...

543
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:55,885
But when you're alone at night,
this shit will haunt you.

544
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:59,756
Trust me on that.

545
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:15,639
- Move... move.
- You don't understand!

546
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,541
No, no, no, listen to me,

547
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,543
you have to stop the attack!

548
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:21,244
Now, I can have you
in handcuffs right now,

549
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,047
so I'm giving you
one last chance.

550
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,049
Convince me not to.

551
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:36,726
People are gonna die!

552
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,528
Stop the attack!

553
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,240
_

554
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,080
_

555
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,838
Go ahead and turn me in.

556
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,310
What attack?

557
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,746
I know what I'm doing
is right...

558
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,053
What attack?

559
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,845
Holy shit...

560
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,850
He did it.

561
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:45,829
We did it.

562
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,981
So what now?

563
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:06,783
Am I forever in limbo,

564
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,986
not knowing
which side I'm really on?

565
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,056
And what about Mr. Robot?

566
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:15,959
Does he now understand
that Tyrell and the Dark Army

567
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:19,829
have corrupted
his alleged revolution?

568
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,899
Does he have any fight left?

569
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,045
If so, who's he gonna fight?

570
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:41,050
Them or me?

571
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:54,063
There were no paper records
in the building,

572
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:57,233
and the Dark Army knew that,

573
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,836
so why did they
try to go today?

574
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:05,108
What was White Rose's
real plan?

575
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,116
Does she know
something I don't?

576
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:23,326
Does everybody know
something I don't?

577
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:36,072
Reports are still coming in
from across the country...

578
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,383
I fought so hard to protect
the New York facility

579
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:50,486
that I couldn't see
the bigger picture.

580
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,958
It wasn't a single point
of failure.

581
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,993
I was.

582
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,797
In a series of seemingly

583
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,166
orchestrated strikes
across the country,

584
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,335
a reported 71 buildings
owned by E Corp

585
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:08,504
exploded or caught fire.

586
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:11,140
There has been
no official confirmation,

587
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:13,977
or even speculation,
as to what caused

588
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,780
the explosions
and fires to occur.

589
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,210
Officials with
knowledge of the attacks

590
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,183
have stated that
the death toll

591
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:23,152
is expected to be
well into the thousands.

592
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,854
Meanwhile, first responders

593
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,089
continue to fight fires

594
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,200
and sort through the rubble,

595
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,390
with the hope of
finding survivors.

596
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:31,527
President Obama
is scheduled to hold

597
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,997
an emergency press conference
later this afternoon

598
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,999
to address
the American public.

599
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:38,001
As of now, no one has...
