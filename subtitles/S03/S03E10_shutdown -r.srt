1
00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:02,265
Everywhere I look you're there.

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,421
- _
- That is why I wanted to meet.

3
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:06,798
So I could find out why you are

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:08,747
so special to Phillip Price.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,875
Why come after me?

6
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:11,062
Your pet project

7
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:12,687
Angela Moss was allowed to

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,208
continue with her lawsuit

9
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:16,044
which put my plans in jeopardy.

10
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:17,858
We're not safe here. I have to warn her.

11
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,628
She has to know what they heard.

12
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,028
Ms. Moss. Ms. Moss, I'm gonna
need you to come with us.

13
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,117
We're ready.

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,882
My exploit will give me full access

15
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,485
to their management interface.

16
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:27,963
Now I own the Dark Army.

17
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,501
I suppose there's some banal excuse

18
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:31,903
why a month isn't enough time

19
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,539
to get my project shipped to the Congo?

20
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,409
Trenton's right.

21
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:36,827
Encryption keys were exported
the night of the hack.

22
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,151
Why would Romero do this?

23
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,314
He did it for the reason
we need those keys now:

24
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,917
in case our revolution failed.

25
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,307
Bang!

26
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,995
- I don't trust him.
- All of his data's

27
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,098
in the FBI evidence storage system.

28
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,035
The FBI. The Dark Army
has a man on the inside.

29
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:52,096
- I'll hit up my contact.
- We can't trust them.

30
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,928
- I might have an angle.
- She was in my home

31
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,190
attempting to steal my
badge to get on Sentinel.

32
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:59,322
There are files that can help
decrypt all of E Corp's data.

33
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,358
What's the plan here?

34
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,827
She talks like she knows everything.

35
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,112
How do you want to proceed?

36
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,706
We haven't seen each other in months.

37
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,894
We've been battling each
other in our own voids.

38
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,744
When we were kids, Darlene
and I, we made this snowman.

39
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:12,614
That was the day my dad
pushed me out the window.

40
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:15,143
You remember when we
made Kevin McCallister?

41
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:16,541
Do you want to talk about it?

42
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,177
Do you remember when you said

43
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,252
Elliot would one day follow

44
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,534
in the footsteps of his father?

45
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,305
I think it's time he died for us too.

46
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,165
_

47
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,570
_

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,055
_

49
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,724
_

50
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,060
_

51
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:23,078
Darlene's not responding
to any of my texts.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,779
If Dark Army's targeting me,

53
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,458
then they're gonna target her next.

54
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:29,050
Hopefully, she made
it to our rendezvous.

55
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:46,281


56
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,382
Wake up.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,969
Let's go. You're coming with me.

58
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,023
Finally you guys came to your sen...

59
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,992
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Shut up.

60
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,861
Are you seriously gonna
arrest me right now?

61
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,296
I told you we can fix this, okay?

62
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,499
Let's just log into Sentinel.
I said shut the fuck up.

63
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,037
It's the EC and 302 from
last night, the Alderson case.

64
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,172
I just submitted it for upload.

65
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:25,974
Why are you giving me this?

66
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:29,086
Um, sorry, Santiago
must not have told you.

67
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,690
You're on the Alderson arrest.
I brought her in last night.

68
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:34,549
No clue what you're talking about.

69
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,151
I'm headed to JFK in 20.

70
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,070
Got a flight to San Fran today.

71
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,416
Santiago!

72
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,180
What are you doing?

73
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:19,985
Taking her to holding.

74
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,830
I thought you were
putting Agent Kaz on this.

75
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:22,931
Why are you doing this yourself?

76
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,032
The ADIC wanted her in holding.

77
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,039
That's what I'm doing. Get back inside.

78
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,849
Fine, I'll take it
up with the ADIC then.

79
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:44,819
Are you gonna finally tell
me what the fuck is going on?

80
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,290
I can't talk to you about it, Dom.

81
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,758
You're not authorized to know.

82
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,429
There's intel you're not privy
to that's connected to this.

83
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:02,298
I'd be more comfortable if
we took it up with the ADIC.

84
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:08,704
If you want to call him, you can.

85
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:09,572
But I...

86
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:14,182
I just don't want you
to embarrass yourself.

87
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,489
What?

88
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:22,742
Are you scared of me now?

89
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,672
There are cameras everywhere.

90
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:27,797
You really think I'm going to do...

91
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,406
She's not here.

92
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,711
Mr. Robot's note.

93
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:47,248
If what he said is true and
the Dark Army owns the FBI,

94
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,583
then maybe she ran into them

95
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:51,286
while she was trying to access Sentinel.

96
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:58,927
Shit.

97
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,927
Dark Army has dozens of operatives

98
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,544
who live in and around Manhattan.

99
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,432
Combing through their
command and control server

100
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:05,934
is going to take too long.

101
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:09,470
There are over 600,000
compromised systems on here.

102
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,344
I can't go through every one.

103
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,141
I don't even know
what I'm searching for.

104
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:14,442
I need something to go on.

105
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:17,879
A name, place, something, anything.

106
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,783
Think, think, think. What do I know?

107
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,718
Anything you can remember? Any detail?

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,653
Anything. Tell me something.

109
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,456
Don't you get it? She's gonna die.

110
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,531
Darlene's gonna die. She's gonna die.

111
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,258
She's gonna fucking
die like everyone else.

112
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,883
I should have never done this.

113
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,885
I should have left this alone.

114
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,887
I'll never learn.

115
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,235
I brought this on myself.

116
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:02,938
I'll never learn.

117
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,529
This is on me.

118
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,704
This is on me.

119
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:25,780
For how many?

120
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:27,149
One.

121
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,210
So, Ferris wheel.

122
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,180
Cute touch.

123
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,258
I need information from you.

124
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:42,296
You do not get to summon
me like you're Ali Baba,

125
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,898
squeeze me for information
then shove me back in some lamp.

126
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,258
Darlene's in trouble!

127
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,794
She might already be dead.

128
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,630
The whole reason you're
in this goddamn mess

129
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,204
is because we're not working together,

130
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,422
because you refuse to talk to me.

131
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,776
I wish that were true.

132
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,031
The sick part is...

133
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,599
I actually missed you.

134
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,724
The only reason we
haven't been talking...

135
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,988
Is because I haven't let myself.

136
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,791
'Cause I've been scared of you.

137
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:25,773
The part of... me that is you.

138
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,887
Why are we talking now?

139
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,211
The 71 buildings.

140
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:43,711
I didn't know about that.

141
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,203
If you did, would you have done it?

142
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,701
Would you have done it?

143
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,703
I would have...

144
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,235
I would have found another way.

145
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:12,531
Because as much as there
is a part of you in me...

146
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,789
there is a part of me in you.

147
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,535
Your note on the mirror,
what did you mean by it?

148
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,190
What do you know?

149
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,164
I need to find Darlene.

150
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,634
Tell me what you know.

151
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,304
The FBI...

152
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,274
has a mole.

153
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,121
You piece of shit.

154
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,628
The attack in China.

155
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:33,000
While you were hiding in your room,

156
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,236
knowing the rest of us were
getting blown to pieces.

157
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,206
Cisco.

158
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,711
You helped them get to him
before we did, didn't you?

159
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:52,052
And the Tyrell cover-up.

160
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,488
You helped frame...

161
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,890
Markesh and Biswas.

162
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:04,283
This whole time, we've been
punching ourselves in the face

163
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:07,000
because of you!

164
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,189
All I know is, if you
were put in my position...

165
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:12,706
Nothing would make me betray
everything I stand for.

166
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:16,618
You know one thing I'll
say about you, DiPierro,

167
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,187
your naivete is adorable.

168
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,290
It's easy for you to play
a hero in the back seat,

169
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,728
but that's all world's ever amounted to.

170
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:25,627
The back seat.

171
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,195
The things I did.

172
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,364
I mean, the... the things
that I have to do...

173
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,556
Are you seriously trying to
paint yourself a saint now

174
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,035
after what you've put us through?

175
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:35,236
You know, the only reason
your girlfriend here is alive

176
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:38,040
is because I never told
the Dark Army she was a CHS.

177
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:41,810
Believe or not, I'm
not a bad guy, DiPierro.

178
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:45,147
You don't understand
what they put me through.

179
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,247
What they hold over me, but you will.

180
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,750
Soon enough.

181
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,623
There's the cocksucker.

182
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,892
Dead center.

183
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,493
According to Wellick,

184
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,509
he's been working both
sides the whole time.

185
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:03,231
Probably the reason we didn't
get pegged for Five/Nine.

186
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,235
We gotta find a way to trace him.

187
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:09,309
Why don't we jump on his desktop?

188
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,479
I already did that
remotely, nothing useful.

189
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,311
Which means whatever we're
looking for is physical.

190
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,495
Number sets.

191
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:34,896
It's another cipher code.

192
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,698
Not this shit again.

193
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,517
This has gotta give us a location.

194
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,520
Elliot. Just give me a minute.

195
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:46,689
Elliot.

196
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,543
Just finished this book.

197
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,517
I got it on tape.

198
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,653
Didn't care much for the ending.

199
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,323
I mean, a story can
have a mediocre beginning

200
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:04,041
and middle, and oftentimes it does,

201
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,166
but always got to have a wow ending.

202
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,697
Otherwise, what's the point?

203
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,365
Shit.

204
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,034
If he's here that means
they must have Darlene.

205
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:15,522
Maybe I can manipulate
him into helping us.

206
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,681
Quick.

207
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,408
- What do we know about...
- Whatever scheme

208
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,677
you're trying to come up with right now

209
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,314
It ain't gonna change
the inevitable, so...

210
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,970
I strongly recommend you
choose the easy way here

211
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:30,886
and come with me.

212
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,836
How'd you sleep last night?

213
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,472
I didn't.

214
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,974
I've been waiting all night.

215
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,343
I need to see her as soon as possible.

216
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,546
I have important information for her.

217
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,782
It's a beautiful day, don't you think?

218
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,356
Look.

219
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:15,096
There are people that
are trying to stop her.

220
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,898
I need to tell her.

221
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,934
Oh, I'm just the house manager.

222
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:22,604
But you can discuss that with
Mr. Price when he arrives.

223
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,974
I thought we'd get some breakfast first.

224
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,817
Do you like pancakes?

225
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,823
It's this way.

226
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:40,343
- Elliot.
- Don't fucking move.

227
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,470
We are walking into some
fucking hillbilly shit here.

228
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:54,098
Now, look.

229
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,116
I know this is all fucked
up, but it's salvageable.

230
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,836
There's a lot of clean-up at the FBI

231
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,811
you're going to have
to take care of for me.

232
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:01,813
Mm-hmm.

233
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:07,034
So this is the plus-one
you've been squawking about?

234
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,515
You're not turning this around on me.

235
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,417
Not after the fucking day I've had,

236
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,120
cleaning up your mess once again.

237
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,656
I'm over it. You hear me?

238
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,210
It's high time you guys start

239
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,343
cleaning up my mess for a change.

240
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,646
Uh-huh.

241
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,843
And by "mess" I assume you mean her.

242
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:36,091
I know how to fix this.

243
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,293
So do I.

244
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,491
All right.

245
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,594
Come on, Miss, let's go.

246
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,209
Leon, you got this?

247
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,977
Yeah, I got it.

248
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,732
Are you okay?

249
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,202
Is that a joke?

250
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,704
We're in a fucking barn
out in the middle of nowhere

251
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,639
with a handful of psychos.

252
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,616
"No" is the answer.

253
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:45,679
Listen, sir.

254
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:48,615
I don't know what you
think I did, but...

255
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:51,108
This guy's a liability to
you. He's gotten sloppy.

256
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:52,519
- You don't have to do this.
- Dom.

257
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,020
My bosses know about everything.

258
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:56,923
There's security camera
footage of him kidnapping

259
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,280
- Ms. Alderson and me...
- Miss.

260
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:01,619
Stop talking.

261
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,319
Hm?

262
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,952
Okay, we got two operatives.

263
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:28,188
Leon's pretty good with a knife.

264
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,825
What are you thinking?

265
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,561
I'm not trying to escape.

266
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,593
Elliot, these guys
aren't fucking around.

267
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,766
Who do you think you're
going to talk to out here?

268
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,435
Who do you think?

269
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:43,670
Whiterose.

270
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,960
You've played that game already.

271
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,197
She doesn't want to see you.

272
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,452
She's seeing us right now.

273
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,738
Fuck me.

274
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,080
Now wait a minute.

275
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:20,482
Let's just slow things down a bit.

276
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,650
We can flip her.

277
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:23,380
She can be very valuable.

278
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,715
- No way I'm flipping.
- Dom.

279
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,382
Don't be stupid. Listen to me.

280
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,223
I'm trying to get you out of this alive.

281
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,126
Valuable, huh?

282
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,561
You think she would've
gone far in the Bureau?

283
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,563
She would have been one
of the youngest ASACs ever,

284
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,698
still could be.

285
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,389
No, she's a rising star.

286
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:44,839
Gumption.

287
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:50,512
But it's like she said,

288
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,080
no way she's flipping.

289
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:56,017
Hey.

290
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,021
Oh, no, no, don't get
too worked up, Miss.

291
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,123
Just look at the sky.

292
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:06,161
Take a deep breath.

293
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:07,929
Try to enjoy the fresh air.

294
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,374
Wait, wait, wait. Dom.

295
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,109
Just tell him you'll flip.

296
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,280
This isn't worth it. You can...

297
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:52,914
Oh, don't mind that.

298
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,545
We're retiring this shit-stain.

299
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,999
And you're taking his place.

300
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,422
You work for the Dark Army now.

301
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:06,654
You're gonna go back to the FBI.

302
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,424
It's gonna be business as usual.

303
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,326
You're gonna feed us any information

304
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:13,361
and answer all our requests.

305
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:17,399
- Fuck you.
- Now, Dom.

306
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:19,667
You're gonna need to get your head

307
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,503
around the position you're in here.

308
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:23,805
I'm no traitor.

309
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,473
You should kill me now

310
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,225
because the first thing I do

311
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,844
when you let me go is
arrest your fucking ass.

312
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,121
The name of your youngest family member,

313
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,524
what is it?

314
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:48,063
Oh, that's right.

315
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:52,801
Four-year-old Jamie
DiPierro of Morrisville.

316
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,694
That's your brother Joseph's kid, right?

317
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,508
Yeah.

318
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,113
I want you to look at this jerk-off

319
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,982
and imagine it's little Jamie.

320
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:22,764
Now I want you to
imagine your mom Trudie...

321
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,800
in Philly.

322
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,238
Now imagine Uncle Chris one morning

323
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,307
as he's picking up his copy...

324
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,909
of the "Dallas Morning Star"!

325
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,984
Or you're older brother, Jerry,

326
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,786
while he's watching

327
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:48,223
"Wheel... of... Fortune!"

328
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,547
Am I illustrating my point?

329
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,508
Dom, I'm going to need
verbal confirmation

330
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,245
that you're grasping the
details of this agreement!

331
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:14,496
Okay.

332
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,395
Okay.

333
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:24,092
In time...

334
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,295
this will get easier to live with.

335
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:30,064
I promise.

336
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:33,758
Head into the barn and
await further instructions

337
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,654
on how to clear up Santiago's missteps.

338
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:43,611
Now, forgive me

339
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:46,114
while I take a moment to center myself.

340
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:55,094
This next bunch...

341
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:57,697
These are for me.

342
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,430
Jesus, Dom, what happened?

343
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:36,166
Looks like she's just
got her initiation.

344
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,171
Want some of this catnip, girl?

345
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,873
All right. Suit yourself.

346
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,370
All right, if we don't figure
out a way get out of here,

347
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,617
they are going to kill us.

348
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,387
Look around you.

349
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,522
They've been instructed to wait.

350
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,790
Not act.

351
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,427
Wait for what?

352
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,998
They're preparing for
someone important to come.

353
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,853
I took care of everything.

354
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,189
As instructed.

355
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,124
Everyone's loaded up in the barn.

356
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,427
You might want to send your guys

357
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,529
to the woodpile over there.

358
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,902
I had to kill the FBI mole.

359
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,971
That's the bad news.

360
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,774
Good news, I got you
someone even better.

361
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,275
She doesn't have as high of a rank,

362
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,711
but she's got tremendous upside.

363
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,213
Besides...

364
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,682
That guy was a dickhead.

365
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:32,716
Anyway.

366
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,452
She's in the barn as well.

367
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:40,891
Where are you going?

368
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,877
Me, I'm gonna take
that overdue sabbatical

369
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,962
I keep talking about.

370
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,965
Finally get to finish my book.

371
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,134
Well, that's the goal anyway.

372
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,302
I'm thinking the Sandals in Barbados.

373
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,471
They got a good special
running this month.

374
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,840
You are not going anywhere.

375
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,376
We have work to do.

376
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,191
Tell me something.

377
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:20,497
She still making her
spontaneous overtures?

378
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:27,504
She make you taste her yet?

379
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,274
Remember, doll face,

380
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:33,210
I was you years ago.

381
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,846
And I've already done my time.

382
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,451
I think she'll be good with me.

383
00:28:48,553 --> 00:28:50,794
Glad we did this.

384
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,739
I want to leave.

385
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,977
My staff not keeping you comfortable?

386
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,713
I wouldn't have come

387
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,915
if I had known this was your house.

388
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,651
I was getting concerned about you.

389
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:15,853
Hadn't been to work for weeks,

390
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:20,324
you're not answering
your phone, your emails.

391
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,659
I sent someone to your apartment.

392
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:28,232
When I saw what you
were doing, I felt I...

393
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,874
I had to intervene.

394
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,853
I'm not supposed to be here.

395
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:53,523
And where do you think
you're supposed to be?

396
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,741
You know where.

397
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:56,860
With her.

398
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,497
She has a plan.

399
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:06,436
Yes, I've known about her
delusional plan for years.

400
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,007
You don't know anything.

401
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,598
Mr. Alderson.

402
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,926
I had a chance to review your
paperwork for Stage Three.

403
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:17,114
- Surprisingly...
- It's bullshit.

404
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:20,150
There is no Stage Three,
but you already knew that.

405
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,354
I'm glad we can be honest.

406
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,402
Now we can talk.

407
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:29,590
The only reason you're
involved in any of this

408
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:32,396
is because I had Colby hire you.

409
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,333
I needed to manipulate you into dropping

410
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,635
that contingency from your lawsuit.

411
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,671
You were threatening her plant.

412
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,606
And she would have done anything

413
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,926
to stop those inspections,

414
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,511
including killing you.

415
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,314
Why would you care if she killed me?

416
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,183
You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

417
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,118
Let go of them.

418
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,687
Then we can talk.

419
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,356
But if I didn't have her

420
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,499
then how am I going to keep you honest?

421
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:06,263
I own everything.

422
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,967
I own every single system
the Dark Army has compromised.

423
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:22,877
I met your mother.

424
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,049
Emily.

425
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,987
32 years ago.

426
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,989
When you took my laptop,

427
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:35,392
you infected yourself with my malware.

428
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,160
If you hurt her,

429
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,329
it will all get released.

430
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:43,300
Every bribe, blackmail,
extortion, operation,

431
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,043
all your illegal connections,

432
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:47,035
everything will go public.

433
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,773
The entire Dark Army history.

434
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,648
That's impossible.

435
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,752
And here I thought we
were going to be honest.

436
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,087
We were both working at E Corp.

437
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:08,091
We dated for quite some time.

438
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,060
Seven days ago, the Russian government

439
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,002
hired you to hack the DNC.

440
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:14,035
- Elliot.
- Two days before that,

441
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:16,859
you bribed the president of
South Korea to allow backdoors

442
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,418
in all of their military networks.

443
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,604
- You're just pissing him off.
- Three weeks before that,

444
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,819
you used Phillip Price to
annex the Congo for China.

445
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,680
Am I being more honest now?

446
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,815
I loved her.

447
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,720
Deeply.

448
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,556
But I never told her.

449
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:43,794
If one of us dies,
everything gets leaked.

450
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:47,998
Well, we can survive a leak.

451
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,635
You can't survive a
bullet through your throat.

452
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,870
The closer we became,
the more I held back.

453
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,440
I was cruel to her

454
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,108
in that way.

455
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,477
It made me feel strong...

456
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,916
To torture her like that... Like that.

457
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,319
We have an opportunity for both of us

458
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,589
to leave with what we want.
I know exactly what you want.

459
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,758
You want to reverse Five/Nine.

460
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,529
And honestly we couldn't
care less about that.

461
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:22,365
It's already served its purpose.

462
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,103
When she told me she was pregnant,

463
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:29,606
she was very emphatic that her child

464
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,109
wasn't going to be raised by a monster,

465
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,173
as she put it.

466
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,875
No!

467
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:41,812
I also know how to move
whatever project you have

468
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:44,654
in the Washington Township
Plant to the Congo.

469
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,070
While you sit back,

470
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:49,860
missing your deadlines, doing nothing,

471
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,710
I've engineered a hack that
can solve all of your problems

472
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:55,413
and I'm willing to give it to you.

473
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,633
Do you hear me?

474
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:59,015
I can move your projects to the Congo!

475
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,804
You'll get what you want!

476
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,758
We won't bother you anymore!

477
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:06,743
Sometime after that she met and then...

478
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,687
She married your father.

479
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,315
Who agreed to raise you as his own.

480
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,518
You're very sure of yourself.

481
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,781
You are just one hacker.

482
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:20,023
What makes you believe
that you are better

483
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:23,570
than an army of people exactly like you?

484
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:26,296
Because I am.

485
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,233
I did something in one night

486
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,036
you've been trying to
pull off for months.

487
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,380
I never planned on telling you,

488
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:47,083
until I realized what
whiterose had done to you.

489
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,968
Look, it's not possible

490
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:51,437
what she's talking about.

491
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,148
Angela, this so-called project of hers,

492
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:59,329
it stems from an obsessive,
psychotic denial of reality.

493
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,265
Don't do this.

494
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,004
Let me help you.

495
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,908
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson.

496
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,912
You're good at playing games.

497
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:20,214
But this was simply
the wrong hand to play.

498
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,355
She has murdered countless people

499
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:28,792
to fulfill this...
this ridiculous fantasy.

500
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,595
History...

501
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,697
is finally coming for you.

502
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,317
What is this?

503
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:01,091
I don't believe you.

504
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,726
You're lying.

505
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,329
I am your father.

506
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,601
Biologically speaking, anyway.

507
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,652
I think that's you, brah.

508
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,253
The Cyber Bombings...

509
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,987
All of those people.

510
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,649
That was my fault.

511
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,667
She used me for that.

512
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,750
Your jealousy has always blinded you

513
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:12,395
to Mr. Alderson's value.

514
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,487
That is why you can never see
my plan through to the end.

515
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,205
I have to believe

516
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,268
there was a purpose.

517
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:27,984
Pettiness.

518
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,716
It was a dig at me.

519
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,589
It's that small, unfortunately.

520
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,925
You can't believe him.

521
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,763
He's... he's lying.

522
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,299
Know that I will find you

523
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,736
as soon as our project is complete.

524
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,439
But for the here and now...

525
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,942
our time has come...

526
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,243
to an end.

527
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,519
_

528
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,287
No, it's not over.

529
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,390
It's not over. It can't be.

530
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,095
She was gonna bring my mom back.

531
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,766
We were gonna be reunited.

532
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:17,056
You made an offer, cuz.

533
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:20,250
Now it's time to pay up.

534
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,495
Please tell me you're not bluffing.

535
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,190
What are you gonna do to her?

536
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,843
What are you asking?

537
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,911
Retribution.

538
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,680
I want it.

539
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,016
Coast Guard is allowing the shipment

540
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,985
of humanitarian aid to Iran.

541
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,988
Trust me.

542
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,389
It'll work.

543
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,330
I'm afraid your only move here...

544
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:04,200
Accept that you've been conned.

545
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,271
It's downloaded.

546
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,723
Now, you know

547
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:15,247
I ain't got to tell you
what they going to do

548
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,847
if this don't check out right.

549
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,549
It'll check out.

550
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,387
You know I've always
had faith in you, cuz.

551
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:32,028
Do your thing.

552
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,098
Find a way to live with what you did.

553
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,837
What do we do now?

554
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,713
Undo the hack.

555
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:28,057
Don't think I'm doing this for you.

556
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:38,734
Dom.

557
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:49,111
You are a terrible person.

558
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,950
Don't ever convince
yourself of anything else.

559
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:57,987
All you deserve for
the rest of your life...

560
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:02,891
is pure and utter agony.

561
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,526
That'll begin to scratch the surface

562
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:06,395
of how I feel about you.

563
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:13,736
You've taken everything from me.

564
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:20,209
My whole life...

565
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:24,447
is ruined because of you.

566
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:29,485
Live with that.

567
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:33,584
Die with that.

568
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:54,043
The FBI had Romero's keylogger files,

569
00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:56,078
but he encrypted them with a password.

570
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,952
Thing is, the FBI didn't know Romero.

571
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:09,958
I do.

572
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,908
Is this really it?

573
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:31,447
The moment this can all truly end?

574
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:37,886
Reverse everything we've done.

575
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:42,380
Finally bring Five/Nine to an end.

576
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:52,134
This is it.

577
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:54,670
Everything that was
typed on those machines

578
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:57,639
at the arcade on the night of the hack.

579
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:03,112
So what'd you find?

580
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:06,148
He didn't do it.

581
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,685
Romero was just spying on us.

582
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:12,888
He caught someone else
exporting the key data.

583
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:21,363
If he didn't do it,
then who the fuck did?

584
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:29,638
Reminder, today's city-wide curfew

585
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,477
starts at 9:00 p.m. this evening

586
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,543
until 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

587
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:36,779
Stay indoors and stay off the streets.

588
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,620
Why did you bring up Kevin McCallister?

589
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,590
The snowman.

590
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:52,861
When we were in Coney Island,
you asked me if I remembered.

591
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:56,131
What was that all
about? It felt so random.

592
00:45:03,474 --> 00:45:06,608
That was the day Dad
pushed me out the window.

593
00:45:11,682 --> 00:45:13,921
What are you... What do you mean...

594
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:17,052
Dad pushed you out the window?

595
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:20,756
He was mad that I told
Mom about his cancer,

596
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:24,693
and he pushed me out the window.

597
00:45:24,695 --> 00:45:27,095
You were young.

598
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,997
I guess I never told you.

599
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:31,066
What are you talking about Elliot?

600
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,535
I was there.

601
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:35,571
We were in your room
looking for a camera

602
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:37,973
when Dad came home.

603
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:39,698
For some reason

604
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:43,912
you freaked out and told
me to go hid in the closet.

605
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:47,182
Then Dad came in the
room, and all of the sudden

606
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:51,119
you... I don't know. You just snapped.

607
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:54,790
You started swinging your baseball bat,

608
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,492
hitting everything.

609
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:01,597
No.

610
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:04,800
That's not what happened.

611
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:09,805
Trust me, I remember.

612
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:13,208
You took your baseball bat
and you smashed the window,

613
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,811
and then you kept telling
Dad you were gonna jump.

614
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,318
Elliot, you weren't pushed.

615
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,055
You jumped.

616
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,534
I don't remember any of that.

617
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:45,240
Well, I'm here to remember for you.

618
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:54,316
This is our stop.

619
00:46:59,957 --> 00:47:03,759
I'm gonna ride the
train a little longer.

620
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:05,327
Are you okay?

621
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:08,997
I'll get it done.

622
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:17,205
Hey. The email from Trenton.

623
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:20,876
I know she sent it to you
because she could trust you.

624
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:22,878
The same as I always have.

625
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:48,170
I'm gonna get off at the next stop.

626
00:47:48,172 --> 00:47:49,471
I think you should come with me.

627
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:03,385
It wasn't Romero.

628
00:48:03,387 --> 00:48:05,988
It was you who exported the keys.

629
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:10,926
Why?

630
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:13,881
We're close, Elliot.

631
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:16,652
You pull the ripcord now

632
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,621
and everything will be for nothing.

633
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,675
There was a huge cost
to get to this point.

634
00:48:26,677 --> 00:48:29,211
I still believe if we
hold out a little longer...

635
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:30,646
No.

636
00:48:32,316 --> 00:48:34,149
You do this,

637
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:36,084
and they will have won.

638
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:41,356
You really believe undoing
this is going to fix anything?

639
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:42,820
Huh? Do you?

640
00:48:42,823 --> 00:48:44,503
I mean, who is this really gonna help?

641
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:46,206
Me.

642
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:57,372
I'm doing this for me.

643
00:49:04,515 --> 00:49:07,282
I can't live with what I did anymore.

644
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:16,458
And you're wrong.

645
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,394
They won't win.

646
00:49:19,396 --> 00:49:23,098
Because one good thing
came out of all of this.

647
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,568
They showed themselves,

648
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,271
the top 1% of the 1%,

649
00:49:29,273 --> 00:49:32,090
the ones in control,

650
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:35,094
the ones who play God
without permission.

651
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,863
And now I'm gonna take them down.

652
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:50,125
All of them.

653
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:54,196
Whatever happens after this,

654
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:56,098
I want us to keep talking.

655
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:01,269
I want us to be a team.

656
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:07,275
I know I can't force you so...

657
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:11,646
I'm asking.

658
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:18,920
I jumped.

659
00:50:21,425 --> 00:50:23,592
I wasn't pushed.

660
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:29,765
Did you know that?

661
00:50:59,363 --> 00:51:02,264
You asked me before why I did this.

662
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,733
We, the damned!

663
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:07,836
The reason is I thought...

664
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:09,905
What if we were wrong?

665
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:18,767
What if there's something
we weren't seeing?

666
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,104
What if we failed?

667
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:28,390
The real reason is it's...

668
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:30,592
It's because it's
what you would've done.

669
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:35,197
You were right.

670
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:37,599
There was a part of you in me.

671
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,264
I never wanted to tell you that

672
00:51:41,267 --> 00:51:43,038
because it's not in my nature.

673
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,575
It's not why I exist.

674
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:48,977
Only you know why I'm here.

675
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:54,783
On the night of the hack,
I transferred the keys

676
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:57,519
from the arcade...

677
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,955
to a remote virtual machine

678
00:51:59,957 --> 00:52:01,756
on our box at home.

679
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:09,064
I then burned it to a CD.

680
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:19,074
You'll find the seed
data and the algorithm

681
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:22,077
embedded in one of those pictures.

682
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:32,454
You'll know the one.

683
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,302
With those two pieces, you
should be able to regenerate

684
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:49,349
the keys that were used

685
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,840
to encrypt all of E Corp's data.

686
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,640
And with that...

687
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:32,714
You can make it like
Five/Nine never happened.

688
00:53:40,124 --> 00:53:47,163


689
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:14,113
This is a reminder,
today's city-wide curfew

690
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,096
begins at 9:00 p.m. this evening

691
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:18,754
through 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

692
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:21,024
Stay indoors and off the streets.

693
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:29,024
Dude, what the fuck? Slow down.

694
00:54:29,027 --> 00:54:30,638
Fucking asshole.

695
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,808
Shit.

696
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:37,712
Like I was saying, this
shit has been fucking rough.

697
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:40,415
I hear you. It's hit everybody.

698
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:43,118
Yeah, the difference
being when it hits you,

699
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,286
you don't have to suck
some cuck's shrimp dick

700
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:47,756
to buy a damn sandwich.

701
00:54:47,758 --> 00:54:50,158
This is true.

702
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,994
I think things are gonna change though.

703
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:54,796
For the better.

704
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:57,132
Soon, so...

705
00:54:57,134 --> 00:54:59,100
Hang in there.

706
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:01,136
Hanging's what I do best.

707
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:03,004
But I don't know what you mean.

708
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:06,007
E Corp's in a world of shit.

709
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:09,744
Daddy lost both his homes
and his bike 'cause of them.

710
00:55:09,746 --> 00:55:12,180
And now this country's attackin' Iran.

711
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:14,916
If anything, this is the
calm before the damn storm.

712
00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:16,718
Yeah, well...

713
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,653
Hold out hope.

714
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:20,922
Trust me. I think...

715
00:55:20,924 --> 00:55:23,727
I think E Corp will be able
to bring back their lost data.

716
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,894
Yeah, well, I hope not.

717
00:55:25,896 --> 00:55:27,962
That just means debt's gonna come back.

718
00:55:27,964 --> 00:55:30,532
And I certainly don't know
how my $80,000 student loan

719
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:32,867
I owe Parsons is gonna
help me fix anything.

720
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:36,604
Well, it's a start.

721
00:55:36,606 --> 00:55:37,988
Path to recovery.

722
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:39,766
The economy will start to bounce back.

723
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:43,478
Girl, you don't have
to sound so simplistic.

724
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,448
That's not the way this
crony capitalism works.

725
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,917
Shit, educate yourself on some Marx

726
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:52,754
before you go just theorizing
about economic forces.

727
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:56,691
Okay, so...

728
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:59,027
What do you think would
fix all of this then?

729
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:03,965
An act of God.

730
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,967
And right about now,

731
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:09,237
he needs a hell of a
good blowjob, just like

732
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,296
every other stressed-out,
powerful motherfucker

733
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:13,032
trying to hold their
shit together, right?

734
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:17,946
Well, this is me.

735
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:20,148
I'm really glad I met you tonight.

736
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,717
You too, babes.

737
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,187
Why you coming to this
ugly ass building anyways?

738
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:28,623
My brother lives here.

739
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:30,825
You think he'd be down
for a good time tonight?

740
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:34,262
Well, he definitely
needs to get laid, but...

741
00:56:34,264 --> 00:56:36,531
I don't think that's gonna happen.

742
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:41,160
- Shit.
- What?

743
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:44,207
There go them damn eses again.

744
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,841
Fuck, and now they parking.

745
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,308
Look.

746
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:49,611
I got to go, babe.

747
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:21,075
Can I help you, fellas?

748
00:57:21,077 --> 00:57:22,777
My sister,

749
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:24,412
only the north stars of the cosmos

750
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:26,110
can help a visionary like me.

751
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:27,615
But, yes,

752
00:57:27,617 --> 00:57:31,152
you can shine a light on
a dark corner of my mind.

753
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:33,354
What?

754
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:34,956
Who are you?

755
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,734
I'm just...

756
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:41,729
I'm just a brave traveler

757
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:43,617
who's finally come home.
