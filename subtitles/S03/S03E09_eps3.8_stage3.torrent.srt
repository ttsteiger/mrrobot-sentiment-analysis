1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:04,418
71 buildings owned by E Corp
exploded or caught fire.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,085
All those people who died,

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,222
they think the total will be over 4,000.

4
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,929
What are you doing?

5
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:12,059
See? They all came back.

6
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,228
I thought I would never win.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,085
Not until I met Whiterose.

8
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,816
Don't think for a
second that I don't know

9
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,519
that you're keeping something from me.

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,034
No, no, no. Listen to me.

11
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:22,870
You have to stop the attack!

12
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,773
Your wife's dead, which
means that your son

13
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,942
is currently being raised at
Peaceful Acres Foster Care.

14
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,213
If you're thinking about
telling anyone here about me,

15
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,116
you won't live to place a
flower at your wife's grave.

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,434
But we still haven't
discussed the coltan mines.

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,720
The fucking Congo can wait.

18
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:42,757
It's time Phillip
Price's hand got slapped.

19
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,051
If the UN approves our
annexation of the Congo,

20
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:48,239
we can finally move our operation.

21
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:51,599
My actions were never
meant to harm E Corp.

22
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,114
Trust me, it will survive.

23
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:54,523
But I won't.

24
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:58,004
Mr. Alderson can die for
us, just like his father.

25
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,872
Something ain't right about this guy.

26
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,875
I don't trust him.

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:01,809
If what I discovered is real,

28
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,910
do you know what that means?

29
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,992
We could potentially
undo this whole thing.

30
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,398
If anything does happen to us,

31
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,215
I sent the email to go out automatically

32
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,398
to someone I trust.

33
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,587
Maybe there still are
things left for me to do.

34
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,356
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

35
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,425
If we lose them, it's
gonna be it for us.

36
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:20,461
It's gonna be it for me.

37
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,502
Allsafe officially
opened its doors in '04.

38
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,504
We have a relatively small roster,

39
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,139
but that way our clients
have unprecedented access,

40
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,141
our undivided attention...

41
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:36,244
All those are standards E Corp expects

42
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:40,281
- from any vendor we hire.
- Terry, please.

43
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,016
Let him continue.

44
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,518
Allsafe has several other clients

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,486
also in the Fortune 100.

46
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,189
And when called upon, we help them out

47
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,792
in some pretty sticky
incident response scenarios.

48
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:53,961
We'll be making a bit
of a splash next month

49
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:55,930
when we release our 2012 report.

50
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,833
That's all teddy bears and hand jobs,

51
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,369
but what are your financials?

52
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,672
We can't wake up one day
and find ourselves tits up,

53
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,140
dicks blowing in the breeze.

54
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,101
Um, well, yes. Of course, of course,

55
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:12,116
Thank you, Angela.

56
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,518
Hey, hon, you want to top me off?

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,722
And add a pinch of Sweet'N
Low, but not too much.

58
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,830
Angela, uh, my assistant
can handle that.

59
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:32,733
- It's okay.
- No, no. It's okay.

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,740
Regarding our financials, Mr. Colby,

61
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,676
this will correspond to page eight.

62
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,986
Well, that was a cute
field trip, Phillip.

63
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:53,554
Next time I waste an afternoon, though,

64
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,078
I'd prefer a happy ending.

65
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,679
Now what's the real angle here?

66
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,559
We headed to Legz & Lace for happy hour?

67
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,362
We're gonna hire them.

68
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:04,198
Set the deal in motion immediately.

69
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,001
What... I... I don't understand.

70
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,098
Is there something bigger
behind the scenes here

71
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,373
we should know about, or...

72
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,043
I want the contract
executed as soon as possible.

73
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,800
Mr. Price, if I may...

74
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,204
I'm hesitant to depend on Allsafe

75
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,539
as our security operation center.

76
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,575
I'm confident I could lead a team

77
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,577
to establish our own internal SOC.

78
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,078
And with the appropriate resources...

79
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,715
I'm sorry, Mister, uh...

80
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,817
- Wellick.
- Wellick! Mr. Wellick!

81
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,887
I'm sorry if I misled you
into thinking that I was

82
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,391
seeking your counsel or approval,

83
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,660
because I most certainly am not.

84
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,801
- Understood.
- Good.

85
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,359
Just hope it doesn't
come back to haunt us.

86
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,976
This decision has been made.

88
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,359
Remember to alert the Bureau

89
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,706
if you're going to leave
the city, Mr. Wellick.

90
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,841
And no international travel for now.

91
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,851
_

92
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,592
Mr. Robot.

93
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,394
He took over again.

94
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,264
"They own the FBI."

95
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,400
What is he trying to say?

96
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,569
Who's "they"?

97
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,144
Dark Army. It's gotta be.

98
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,929
Fuck, I left my machine unlocked.

99
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,965
Trenton's email.

100
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,633
Did he see this?

101
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,035
If he did, he knows
that Trenton was close

102
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,012
to finding a way to undo Five/Nine

103
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,843
and that I'm gonna
finish what she started.

104
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:46,206
He also looked up info on
Tyrell Wellick's release.

105
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,821
Why?

106
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,828
What exactly did Mr. Robot do last night?

107
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,288
Seventy-one buildings.

108
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,323
Was it worth it?

109
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,492
Get the fuck out of my home.

110
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,968
Gotta say, your revised
plan was batshit insane.

111
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,442
It was supposed to be only one
building, but what you did...

112
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,703
I did what had to be done.

113
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:39,998
You mean, what they told you to do.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,453
What'd they promise you, huh? Money?

115
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,602
This isn't about them.

116
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,234
This is about when you fucked me!

117
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,104
I lost everything because of you.

118
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:50,711
My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!

119
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,579
Okay.

120
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,882
Okay, I can't say that it's
all been smooth sailing,

121
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,262
but you gotta see the big picture.

122
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:57,785
There is no big picture!

123
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,254
There was a job, and
I fulfilled my duty,

124
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,089
and that's more than I can say for you.

125
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,421
Oh, come on! You know damn well

126
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:04,997
that's not how the Dark Army works.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,361
You don't go from most
wanted man on the planet

128
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,929
to hero unless they have plans for you,

129
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,312
how can you not see that?

130
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,333
The things I did, the
things I sacrificed,

131
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,801
I earned my freedom.

132
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,302
That's the least they could give me.

133
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,737
Horseshit. You're being added

134
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,372
to a collection of puppets.

135
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,541
No puppet, no puppet. You're the puppet!

136
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:24,144
Wake up! You made a deal with
a force that's bigger than you!

137
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,347
When the time comes,
they're gonna ask you to pay

138
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,148
what they feel you owe them!

139
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,036
This is a childish conspiracy!

140
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,700
Childish? Who's the one
who said we were gods, huh?

141
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,747
Time to grow up. There are no gods.

142
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,558
Our closest deities are
a society of the richest,

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,393
most influential men in existence.

144
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,661
I'm done with this.

145
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,614
Men who fuck over the
rest of us for profit,

146
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:45,399
for fun, and then leave
us in the streets for dead.

147
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:48,068
Just like your Joanna!

148
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,618
You don't talk about my wife.

149
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,622
Wouldn't she want you to
realize the truth and fight?

150
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,536
Or would she want you
to be their little bitch?

151
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,040
There you go. Fight!

152
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,308
That's the Tyrell who's been missing.

153
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,977
Now you want to stop them, too,

154
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,622
before they put you
in that choke collar?

155
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,947
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

156
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,995
What?

157
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,596
Oh, hello, sir.

158
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,546
May I come in?

159
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,479
Oh, shit.

160
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,351
Didn't mean to interrupt.

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,558
Good evening, Mr. Alderson.

162
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,734
Please join us.

163
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,398
After all, you were a part of this too.

164
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,082
It's weird, being here again.

165
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:43,617
Like we've come to that slow glide

166
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,086
at the end of a roller coaster.

167
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,322
We're coming full circle.

168
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,891
Darlene and Mr. Robot
started this whole thing,

169
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,893
and now she and I are gonna end it.

170
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:54,728
Trenton was investigating Romero

171
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,097
ever since she found out he
was monitoring our machines.

172
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,489
This is big.

173
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,904
Why'd she send this to you?

174
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,099
I don't know.

175
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,651
If Trenton's right, and encryption keys

176
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,294
were exported the night of the hack,

177
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:13,147
then there's a chance we can
recover all of E Corp's data.

178
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,648
If we can find those keys.

179
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,984
Why would Romero do this?

180
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,819
There was never supposed to be a Plan B,

181
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,150
that was the whole point.

182
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,589
This hack was supposed to be all in.

183
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,892
He did it for the reason
we need those keys now,

184
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,494
in case our revolution failed.

185
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,562
We need access to his keylogger files.

186
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,400
The feds confiscated his drives.

187
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:33,478
Now all of his data is in the
FBI evidence storage system.

188
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:36,069
Sentinel, yeah, I know it well.

189
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,794
That's why I'm here.

190
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:40,340
I need you to give me all the
intel you have about the FBI.

191
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,243
You do realize this isn't
Angela batting her lashes

192
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:44,845
at some feds to drop a femtocell

193
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,547
at their E Corp office?

194
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,116
Sentinel is the Fort
Knox of closed networks.

195
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,084
And you want us to just
waltz in there and...

196
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,120
Not us.

197
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,788
Me. I'm gonna do it.

198
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,024
Did you not hear me?
You will get busted.

199
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,193
I don't care how good you think you are.

200
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,801
The only way we do
this is if I go to them.

201
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:10,971
I'll hit up my contact...
We can't trust them.

202
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:15,709
The Dark Army owns the FBI.

203
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,911
- How do you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

204
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:21,949
Going to them isn't an option.

205
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:25,516
- I might have an angle.
- No, I told you...

206
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,986
I spent the last two months
working with the feds.

207
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:31,124
I know how the operate. I'm
miles ahead of you on this.

208
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,659
Okay? I can do this.

209
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:34,861
What's your angle?

210
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:39,433
My angle is you trust me.

211
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,202
You gotta promise me.

212
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,450
Any sign of trouble, you bail.

213
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,317
Even if we do this,

214
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,879
do you really think
it'll make a difference?

215
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,948
I mean the whole world has gone to shit.

216
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,486
And we did that. All we
can do now is rebuild.

217
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:03,023
At least that's a start.

218
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,067
And the Dark Army?

219
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,627
You think they're just gonna be
painting each other's toenails

220
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,796
while we go and undo
everything they've worked for?

221
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:13,734
You just worry about
getting into Sentinel.

222
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:17,804
Let me worry about the Dark Army.

223
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,673
Believe me now?

224
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,009
Lovely lady like you with a Taurus?

225
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:24,378
I don't think so. It's not a good fit.

226
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,013
But this baby, huh?

227
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,514
It's nice.

228
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,616
Bang a left up here.

229
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:34,688
I hear you're looking
to barter a TAG Heuer?

230
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,757
My ex-husband's.

231
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,925
I'm sure we can arrange a deal.

232
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:42,663
And I really want to feel
you pump the gas here.

233
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,931
Let her open up.

234
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:49,369
Yeah?

235
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,020
Doesn't that feel good?

236
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,608
Oh.

237
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,559
Is this supposed to...
I think it's dead.

238
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,447
You know what? Coast her to
the shoulder here on the left.

239
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,255
I'll check things out.

240
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,055
Onboard computer's so smart,

241
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,856
it probably senses something.

242
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,786
What are you doing?

243
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,880
You know what to do.

244
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:32,245
Tell you what, why don't you
stroll on back to the lot,

245
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,982
peruse those Sonatas.

246
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:37,617
I'll meet you there in a second.

247
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,119
Go ahead.

248
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,755
I'm right behind you.

249
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,998
I called OnStar and the
cops are on their way,

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,501
so we don't have much time.
I need you to set a meet.

251
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,205
Look kid, I already
told you, we're done...

252
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,671
Stage Three.

253
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,458
What the fuck is Stage Three?

254
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,410
Just do what you do and
set the meet with Whiterose.

255
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,361
Since when do I take orders from you?

256
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,013
If you don't move on this,

257
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:09,249
it'll be on you to tell your employer

258
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,284
why you fucked with their timeline.

259
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,632
Hey.

260
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,368
You're late.

261
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,438
I'm surprised you agreed to meet.

262
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,039
Thought you weren't
allowed one-on-ones.

263
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,639
Technically, you're
not a source anymore,

264
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,410
so I'll classify this as a social meet.

265
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:43,147
But I suggest you get to
the point of why you called.

266
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,449
First, how about a peace offering?

267
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,718
Shots?

268
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,952
You said you had something to tell me.

269
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:51,445
So talk or this is over.

270
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,494
I've been thinking about
our last conversation.

271
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,663
Especially after...

272
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,757
Everything with Trenton and Mobley,

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,967
and you were right.

274
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,663
There are things I haven't told you.

275
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,265
I'm listening.

276
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:18,015
Okay, well, how does this work?

277
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:21,985
Is this off the record, or
am I fucking my own immunity?

278
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:23,320
Depends.

279
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,201
Everything you said, you were on point.

280
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,937
Whiterose was behind everything.

281
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:43,106
Five/Nine, the Dark
Army were our partners.

282
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:46,325
They handled the Chinese side,
we took care of it over here.

283
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:49,613
And Whiterose, did you talk to him?

284
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,781
There was a middle man.

285
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,140
If the Dark Army was involved,

286
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:54,718
then Whiterose had to greenlight it.

287
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,421
Would you be willing to go on
the record about what you know?

288
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,025
If I testified...

289
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,961
You know what the
Dark Army's capable of.

290
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,263
Darlene, you gotta rethink this.

291
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:10,267
We can protect you,
we'll make things right.

292
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,104
Tyrell's walking free,
and your friends are dead.

293
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,937
Do it for them!

294
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:25,282
Fine. I gotta use the bathroom.

295
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,618
Fuck...

296
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,283
This is a reminder that
today's city-wide curfew

297
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,184
begins at 9:00 p.m. this evening

298
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,453
through 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

299
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,923
Stay indoors and off the streets.

300
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,167
This is proof.

301
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,102
It's finally happening.

302
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,788
We're going back to the
way things should be.

303
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,249
Angela, I want to help you,

304
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:39,690
but you got to explain to me
what you think is happening.

305
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,788
I can't tell you that.

306
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,960
Only Whiterose can do that.

307
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,133
Whiterose manipulated you.

308
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,803
She exploited your
feelings about your mom,

309
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,005
and used them against
you. That's what she does.

310
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,641
I thought that you
wanted our parents back.

311
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,132
That's never going to happen.

312
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:10,710
That's because you don't understand.

313
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,030
We can't talk here.

314
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:23,266
There are people that
are trying to stop this.

315
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:26,536
Let's go inside.

316
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:28,939
I know this may sound like bullshit,

317
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:32,042
but I'm sorry I was
such a pain in the ass.

318
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:36,313
The pressure of trying to find
Tyrell and lying to my brother,

319
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,582
and secluding myself in that apartment,

320
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,017
just feeling lonely as shit,

321
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,054
I guess it was just too much.

322
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,723
So this is my long-winded
way of saying I don't think

323
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,792
I have it in me to testify.

324
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:53,130
Maybe I'm not as cool
and collected as I put on.

325
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,867
I get the front you put up.

326
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,902
It's a trick I use myself.

327
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,271
You are an FBI agent,

328
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:06,276
yet somehow I feel like you're
the only one I can trust.

329
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,278
Maybe that's because you can.

330
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,983
Yeah. Maybe so.

331
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:16,453
Okay, well, I hope the intel helped.

332
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,222
Sorry I couldn't do more.

333
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:20,991
You're leaving?

334
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:24,127
Thanks for the drink, and for listening.

335
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,130
Wait, you want another?

336
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,166
On me?

337
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,240
So you still single?

338
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,776
Wow!

339
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:44,147
Jumping right into
this conversation again.

340
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:45,949
Haven't you learned my social game

341
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,117
isn't my strong suit?

342
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,752
Well, I'm willing to bet

343
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:51,154
you've got some untapped talent.

344
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,023
What's your type?

345
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,791
Where are you going with this?

346
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:58,428
Well, I am one hell
of a wingwoman, okay?

347
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,932
So let's pick you out one
of these lovelies here.

348
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,502
What about that ginger?

349
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,505
What, are you not into
fire crotch? Hypocrite.

350
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,607
Dye job.

351
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,376
Fine.

352
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:17,614
Goth hipster in the corner?

353
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,349
Identity issues.

354
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,853
Oh, okay.

355
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:26,823
Ooh, what about that?

356
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,957
Oh, my God. Barkeep! Another round.

357
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,343
'Sup, cuz?

358
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:39,547
Oh, shit. Sorry, dude.

359
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,649
Don't let me interrupt
your flow or anything,

360
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,385
I mean I didn't know
you had a female caller.

361
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,555
Who's he?

362
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,558
This is why you're asking
about our plan, isn't it?

363
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,927
Angela.

364
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,162
You've been trying to
listen to me, haven't you?

365
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,464
Did you hear me?

366
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,345
Did you hear what we
were saying out there?

367
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:01,569
I've just been sitting here,
smoking these trees, girl.

368
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:05,372
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

369
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:07,408
You're trying to trap me.

370
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,642
Aren't you?

371
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,749
Angela.

372
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,117
You have to leave.

373
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,020
Get out now, trust me.

374
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:23,657
You've been trying to trick me.

375
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,926
That's why you wanted
me to explain everything.

376
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:28,037
It's you who's trying to stop our plan.

377
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,399
I thought you were on my side.

378
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,635
Dude, your girl's trippin'.

379
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:36,704
Look, I don't know what
you guys got going on,

380
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,857
and I'm sorry, sweetheart,

381
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,174
but we really ain't
got the time right now.

382
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:44,812
We got business to attend
to, and she-she gotta go, bro.

383
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:49,049
- One way or another.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

384
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,652
You're not going to get any
more information out of me.

385
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,028
Slow your roll, cuz.

386
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,099
We gotta get.

387
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,318
We got a tight schedule to maintain.

388
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,506
I am here mainly as
a formality, Wellick,

389
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:17,311
to fake a smile and
pretend to welcome you back.

390
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:23,117
You have been appointed CTO at E Corp.

391
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:31,292
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

392
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,261
- You coming here personally...
- Yes, yes. Right, right.

393
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:37,765
But the direct purpose of my visit...

394
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,073
I felt it was important
to share with you formally

395
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:44,538
that the CTO title is
nothing more than that.

396
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,610
You are a mere figurehead I inherited

397
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:52,613
from a deal gone wrong.

398
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:56,050
It happens from time to time.

399
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,719
But I wanted you to understand
the nature of your position

400
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:03,326
in case you should have loftier designs.

401
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:06,794
There'll be none of that.

402
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:12,299
Obedience will be your
only task at my company.

403
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:16,370
I worry that could
potentially get awkward

404
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:19,840
if you thought differently,

405
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:23,326
so I came here out of respect.

406
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:37,107
By your silence, I assume
you accept this position?

407
00:25:38,594 --> 00:25:42,930
I know what this is.

408
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,900
You're embarrassed that you fired me.

409
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:49,003
There's no shame in admitting the truth.

410
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,606
You're out of moves and
your company needs me.

411
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:56,343
E Corp needs my image,
the face of a hero.

412
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,712
That's why you're here.

413
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh, Wellick, Wellick.

414
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:09,156
It's not that I'm out of moves.

415
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,692
It's that you're not worth one.

416
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,934
See you at the office, mm?

417
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:23,537
Five/Nine, fsociety.

418
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:26,273
You knew the entire time, didn't you?

419
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:29,376
Five/Nine, yes.

420
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:33,213
Well, not all the minutiae, of course.

421
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,282
But since the cyber bombings,

422
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:38,919
the breadcrumbs haven't been
that difficult to follow.

423
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:42,122
World catastrophes like this,

424
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:45,759
they aren't caused by
lone wolves like you.

425
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:51,765
They occur because
men like me allow them.

426
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,435
You just happened to
stumble into one of them.

427
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:58,105
No, no. I ran the operation.
I pushed the button.

428
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:00,074
- I am the one...
- There you go again.

429
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,610
"I, I, I..."

430
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:06,013
You're still thinking like a lone wolf.

431
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,451
Why don't you tell me
how I should be thinking?

432
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,952
Like a leader!

433
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:13,821
I am a leader!

434
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:15,789
Then where are your followers?

435
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:28,802
You can't force an agenda, Mr. Alderson.

436
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:32,706
You have to inspire one.

437
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,381
Nice digs.

438
00:27:40,383 --> 00:27:41,949
Remember, I only let you in

439
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,218
because you said you're not into girls.

440
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,221
No, I said I wasn't
a lesbian, end quote.

441
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,256
I didn't say I wasn't into girls.

442
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,329
Very clever.

443
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,198
How about that nightcap?

444
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,868
Right, but only one.

445
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,171
I gotta work in the morning,

446
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,307
and you gotta get home before curfew.

447
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,813
Screw curfew.

448
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:13,902
Hey, that rhymes.

449
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:18,552
An E Kit?

450
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:21,188
God, I can't believe you
bought into that shit.

451
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,923
You can never be too prepared.

452
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:24,355
Such a Girl Scout.

453
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:28,362
You think that's Girl
Scout-y? Check this out.

454
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:31,231
Alexa, give me the daily Five/Nine.

455
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,902
Hello, and welcome to your
daily Five/Nine report.

456
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:38,072
Officials advise to stay away
from the Upper East Side,

457
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:41,241
where armed theft is at peak levels.

458
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,177
Impressive.

459
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,447
What else does that thing do?

460
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:48,549
Alexa, play John Prine.

461
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,883
Shuffling songs by John Prine.

462
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:54,691
That's better.

463
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:07,067
Why you didn't go after
that blonde is beyond me.

464
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:10,270
She was mint. Wasn't meant to be.

465
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,801
Whatevs. You didn't even try.

466
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:19,125
Jesus H., I think I'm drunk.

467
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:24,818
But it's...

468
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,320
Probably a good thing,

469
00:29:26,322 --> 00:29:29,490
'cause I have like
legit trouble sleeping.

470
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:31,792
I take melatonin, but I
gotta down, like, six of them

471
00:29:31,794 --> 00:29:33,613
to even get drowsy, and then...

472
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,633
What was that?

473
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:42,816
- It's cool.
- No, it's...

474
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,853
No, it's not.

475
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:53,147
What am I doing? This
isn't professional.

476
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:58,185
Dude, you said it yourself.
I'm not a source anymore.

477
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:02,856
Believe it or not, I'm
actually a real person.

478
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,695
- Darlene, seriously.
- All right.

479
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:13,200
Fine. I'm sorry, it's just...

480
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,702
I like you.

481
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:17,938
You're drunk.

482
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,715
Come on, at least give
me more credit than that.

483
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:41,161
Wait, hold on.

484
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:43,096
Um, one second.

485
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,225
You could've kept the gun on.

486
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:16,830
Don't overthink this.

487
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:57,226
We have to get moving.

488
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:59,995
We're not safe here.

489
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:03,632
I have to warn her. She
has to know what they heard.

490
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:10,632
I could just get on the subway,
she'll find us like before.

491
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:12,261
She'll protect us.

492
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,231
Since the cyber bombings,

493
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,799
there's been a wave of backlash

494
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,835
against the FBI from
Americans of all backgrounds

495
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,839
and political views...

496
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:27,243
The one thing we heard
over and over from those...

497
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,079
Was the sentiment that our
law enforcement agencies

498
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,381
can no longer be trusted.

499
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:42,161
You ready?

500
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,041
Yo, Dr. Wang. How you doing?

501
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,874
And this is where we part ways.

502
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,377
Peace, brother.

503
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,180
Your bag.

504
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,499
Where we going?

505
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:19,995
Shut the fuck up. No questions.

506
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,549
I hear you have some
information on Stage Three.

507
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,928
I need my laptop. It has my plans.

508
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,064
It's fine.

509
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,600
We can pull everything
we need from there.

510
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,636
Why don't you have a seat?

511
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:12,643
Your password.

512
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,959
The first time you and I met
to discuss the E Corp hack,

513
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,562
you said this was a two-step plan.

514
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:31,934
So I'm sure you can imagine my
surprise when out of the blue,

515
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,304
I now hear there is a third.

516
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:40,976
So, Mr. Alderson, why don't
you tell me what it is you want?

517
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,445
I asked for a meet with Whiterose.

518
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:46,181
I'll relay any messages to her.

519
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,050
I need to speak with her directly.

520
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,487
You've had all the time
you'll ever get with Whiterose.

521
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,756
I thought she wanted to kill E Corp.

522
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,624
Yes, I believe that's what we did.

523
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,326
No, E Coin didn't exist

524
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,395
when we first created this plan.

525
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,797
Now it's the only thing
keeping them afloat.

526
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,899
It's becoming the world standard.

527
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:09,104
And E Corp's entire
existence relies upon it.

528
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:12,174
So what do you propose we do?

529
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,675
If you truly want to end them,

530
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:17,513
eliminating E Coin is the only way.

531
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,215
Mr. Alderson, is this everything

532
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:23,085
that you came to discuss with me?

533
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,888
Anything else on your mind?

534
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,341
Are you in or out?

535
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,498
Good-bye, Mr. Alderson.

536
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,052
I got CDs, everybody, come on!

537
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,554
They get your turnt!

538
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,723
Scan me 05 E Coin, it's yours!

539
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:07,296
I got CDs! CDs! Yo, this
shit'll get you turnt!

540
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,333
All right, scan me 05
E Coin, and it's yours!

541
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:16,472
Hey, these savage
tracks'll give you life, yo.

542
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,041
No.

543
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,944
I will not take your CD this time.

544
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,548
Miss Moss?

545
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,650
Mrs. Moss, I'm gonna
need you to come with us.

546
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:31,153
CDs! CDs!

547
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,822
This shit'll get you turnt!

548
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,091
Scan me 05 E Coin, and it's yours!

549
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,259
We're ready.

550
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,583
So this is why you came here.

551
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:39,144
You're not talking your way out of this.

552
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,166
Well, you were right.

553
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,602
Everything we did was what they wanted.

554
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,437
Exactly.

555
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,808
Whiterose, Price, and who
the fuck knows who else?

556
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,246
I'm a prisoner, just like before.

557
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,915
Where does that leave me?
What am I supposed to do?

558
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,618
The CTO position is
worthless. You heard him.

559
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,420
We can use it.

560
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,323
You see how they
operate? In the shadows.

561
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,427
You just settle in, smile, nod.

562
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,463
When the time is right...

563
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,165
we'll expose them.

564
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,433
Do you get it now?

565
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,469
E Corp, they might as
well be a front for them!

566
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,672
Whiterose, Price, their friends,

567
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:33,342
they're the ones we need to take down.

568
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,510
We just need a launching pad.

569
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:39,314
A place to begin, dig in.

570
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:43,986
Find that vulnerability.

571
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,754
The FBI.

572
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,293
The Dark Army has a man on the inside.

573
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,472
- I don't understand.
- How do you not understand?

574
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:55,922
You were trying to hack me.

575
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:57,499
An FBI agent.

576
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,967
And I already told you why.

577
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,235
Your bullshit's not gonna fly!

578
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,305
Enough!

579
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,527
You gonna fill me in?

580
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,530
Tell him.

581
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,714
Get fucked.

582
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:17,219
Every time you guys get intel,
one of my friends ends up dead.

583
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,154
And Tyrell's bullshit release

584
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,490
was as pathetic as a dry hand job.

585
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,593
Why should I trust you
or anyone else here?

586
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,497
The FBI is obviously in
bed with the Dark Army.

587
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,831
Where'd you hear that?

588
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,834
Chew balls.

589
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,741
Just tell me.

590
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,372
Why is she here?

591
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,283
She was in my home,
attempting to steal my badge

592
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,085
to get on Sentinel.

593
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,020
Full disclosure, sir,
we had relations tonight.

594
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,689
I plan on self-reporting it to the OPR,

595
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,925
I'm not keeping
anything from the Bureau.

596
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,095
Do you have any idea how fucking big

597
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,630
the crime you committed is?

598
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,432
You can forget about immunity this time.

599
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,866
And why the hell were you trying

600
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:06,568
to get into Sentinel anyway?

601
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,140
You're in too deep this time, Darlene.

602
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:14,176
You gotta talk.

603
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,750
There are files in Sentinel
that can help decrypt

604
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,419
all of E Corp's data.

605
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:27,823
That means bringing everything back.

606
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,727
The solution to undoing
Five/Nine is in a machine

607
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,062
on the other side of this floor, okay?

608
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,164
They're in Romero's collection.

609
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,801
Sit with me, look over my shoulder,

610
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:42,804
I'll even walk through it
with your engineer, whatever.

611
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:46,375
You guys can personally
take the keys to E Corp

612
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,078
and be the heroes, okay?
You can fix everything.

613
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,750
Isn't that what you want?

614
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,918
What you've been waiting for?

615
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,789
She's right! Wasn't this the
point of our entire strategy?

616
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,760
You need to understand something...

617
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:03,587
This is the opportunity
we've been chasing!

618
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,838
- You're missing the point.
- We have nothing to lose.

619
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,096
If she's lying, we put her
in jail, but if she's not...

620
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,998
And what if our
testimony gets thrown out

621
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,334
because of your grossly
unprofessional behavior?

622
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,303
Sleeping with a CHS, for Chrissake.

623
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:17,228
She's not a CHS anymore.

624
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,477
And you know I didn't break any rules.

625
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:25,614
So what's really happening here?

626
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,283
Why not take her up on her offer?

627
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,218
Get back to your desk and write the 302

628
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,523
explaining your actions
minute by minute.

629
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,559
I'm assigning Agent Kaz to Darlene.

630
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,605
That will continue to
be part of the debate...

631
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:51,829
What's the plan here? She talks

632
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,030
like she knows everything.

633
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,743
You sound stressed.

634
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,379
Of course I'm fucking
stressed. I could be burnt.

635
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,882
Meanwhile, she claims
she can undo the hack.

636
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:03,151
And where is she now?

637
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,033
Locked in a goddamn interview room.

638
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,328
Okay.

639
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,864
Is that all you've got? "Okay"?

640
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,366
Jesus, will you just tell me
how do you want to proceed?

641
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,986
Not one box even packed?

642
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:26,508
I suppose there's some
banal excuse why a month

643
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,110
isn't enough time for those lazy mules

644
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,312
to get my project shipped to the Congo?

645
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,642
Border security.

646
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,722
Border security across
the Eastern seaboard

647
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,057
is restricted to levels
we've never seen before.

648
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,693
Hence our extensive payroll.

649
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,563
We own mayors, district attorneys,

650
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,066
governors, fucking presidents!

651
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,069
The country is operating
under martial law.

652
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,573
Our contacts are afraid.

653
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:02,144
You've always asked that
I be honest with you.

654
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,980
Speak.

655
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,955
This is your fault.

656
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,856
You blindly indulge all
of Elliot Alderson's whims.

657
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,091
And it has landed us here.

658
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,594
If you'd listened to me,

659
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,531
if you believed in my strategy
as much as you did his,

660
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,833
we could have avoided this.

661
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,604
We had the UN vote, these
attacks weren't necessary.

662
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:48,490
People like Phillip Price
do not respect mercy.

663
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:53,562
You only get their attention
with force and a lot of it.

664
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:58,600
That is the only
currency with these men.

665
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,984
I will go back to our partners

666
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,154
with a more persuasive argument.

667
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,220
See? That's all I needed to hear.

668
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:28,798
And...

669
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:32,920
What now?

670
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,073
I keep looking at this note,

671
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,509
wondering what Mr. Robot did last night.

672
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,303
If the Dark Army does own the FBI,

673
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:20,382
how did he find out?

674
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:33,461
Does it matter? I don't need him.

675
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,932
Darlene will be checking
in soon about Sentinel,

676
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:42,137
and I have to enact Stage Three.

677
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:48,310
Mr. Alderson is claiming
there is a third stage.

678
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,580
He wants to target E-Coin.

679
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,337
But I'm sure you knew all
along there is no Stage Three.

680
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:03,658
A third stage. Odd.

681
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,826
That wasn't part of our
original plan, was it?

682
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,831
- No.
- So what do you make of that?

683
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:14,136
His sister is currently
being held at the FBI.

684
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:18,373
Claiming she can decrypt E Corp's data.

685
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:24,314
I can't help but notice
their actions are incongruous.

686
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:30,052
He's lying to us.

687
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:34,089
I don't think their
target is E Corp anymore.

688
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,529
I think it's us.

689
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,764
When the Dark Army operatives' malware

690
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,535
copies my file to their
command and control server...

691
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,936
Get yourself back to work.

692
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,655
It'll be queued up for an operator

693
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:52,207
to review its contents.

694
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,844
Once opened, my exploit
will give me full access

695
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,746
to their management interface.

696
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,877
Why the dismay?

697
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,886
We expected something like
this out of him, did we not?

698
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:08,724
You never understood my
commitment to Mr. Alderson.

699
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:12,461
You say that I was wrong
to order the attack.

700
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:15,063
Maybe I'm wrong about him as well.

701
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,532
So tell me,

702
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:22,213
what would you do if you had your way?

703
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,885
And now I own the Dark Army.

704
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,064
Do you remember when you said Elliot

705
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:49,096
will one day follow in the
footsteps of his father?

706
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:58,713
I think it's time he died for us too.

707
00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:04,381
