1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:03,253
- _
- 71 buildings exploded or caught fire.

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,089
Elliot, tell me what it
is that you think he did.

3
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:07,250
Sorry. I don't know if I can say.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,185
No matter what happens now,

5
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:11,625
everything will be fine.

6
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:13,469
I should be at home with my family.

7
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,438
My brother is probably
flipping out right now.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,640
- I'll be back later.
- What do normal people do

9
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,891
when they get this sad?

10
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,868
I do morphine.

11
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,145
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

12
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:25,181
We can potentially
undo this whole thing.

13
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:28,317
Everything in this room is
only here to tell a story.

14
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,188
If anything does happen to us...

15
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,029
If I don't make it back to my computer,

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,056
I sent the email to
go out automatically.

17
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:35,091
No, don't do this!

18
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:36,592
Stop!

19
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,242
To someone I trust.

20
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:39,911
Your dad pushed you out a window?

21
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,764
Broke my arm. Went to the hospital.

22
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,099
I was angry.

23
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,446
I hated myself.

24
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,419
It's okay. I'll get it out of my system

25
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,321
before the movie. Don't you worry.

26
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:06,750
Here.

27
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:11,260
All right. Dump them on in there.

28
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:18,467
Come on. You know what to do.

29
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,166
Come on, kiddo. Shake 'em up.

30
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,018
What? You don't want any?

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,787
Told you I didn't wanna come.

32
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,889
I know, but...

33
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,858
It's movie night. Is it the movie?

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,194
I thought you wanted
to see "Shallow Grave."

35
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,695
I hear it's pretty good.

36
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:53,969
Um, maybe we could see
this, uh, "Jerky Boys" thing.

37
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,372
Maybe it's not sold out yet.

38
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,743
I wanna go home.

39
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,479
How long are you gonna be mad at me?

40
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,173
- I told you I was sorry.
- You're not sorry.

41
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,210
You're just sick and
don't want to admit it.

42
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:14,590
You're right.

43
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,727
I made some mistakes.

44
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,769
I wish I could have been
a better father to you.

45
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,971
All I'm asking is that you forgive me.

46
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,542
Do you think you'll
ever be able to do that?

47
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,413
No.

48
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:47,447
Yeah.

49
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,993
Maybe we should leave.

50
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,245
- Oh, my!
- Somebody call 911!

51
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,150
Shh, the movie's about to start.

52
00:03:57,194 --> 00:04:00,896
Welcome. Your movie will begin shortly.

53
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,898
Please keep our theaters clean

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,655
by disposing of your trash

55
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:07,069
in the specified waste containers.

56
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,339
Food and refreshments are
available in the lobby.

57
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,014
Gift certificates are only available

58
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,110
on special occasions.

59
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:19,648
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

61
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,650
_

62
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,454
When you delete something,

63
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:30,452
you're making a choice to destroy it.

64
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,591
To never see it again.

65
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:44,099
You choose to delete because
you need to free up space.

66
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,071
Because you don't want it anymore.

67
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,376
Because it no longer holds value.

68
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,865
Is that what happened
to Mobley and Trenton?

69
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,322
Were they unwanted?
Taking up too much space?

70
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,970
_

71
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,954
- You can't keep doing this.
- What?

72
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,041
Why did you wipe-down?

73
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,276
Routine.

74
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,751
You need to talk to Angela.

75
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,854
She is not doing well.
Last time I saw her,

76
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,756
she was going through
a full-on breakdown.

77
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,924
I don't care.

78
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:52,728
She should be breaking down.

79
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,829
Nice.

80
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,365
I recall her being there for you

81
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,300
when you had your little episode.

82
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:01,103
Multiple times. Guess I'm an asshole.

83
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,377
It's been three weeks.

84
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,946
You haven't left your apartment.

85
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,081
- I'm getting worried about you.
- Don't.

86
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,218
What happened with the
attacks, that's not you.

87
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,555
Even if it was him, it was me.

88
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,660
How do you even know he did this?

89
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,629
What does it even matter, Darlene?

90
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:31,200
He got what he wanted. Didn't he?

91
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:34,436
Except, wait a minute. Nope.

92
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:37,973
E Corp's still gonna be
just fine because of Ecoin.

93
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,342
He sure didn't see that coming, did he?

94
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,244
Whoops! Oh, well.

95
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,646
Consolation prize, at least we get to be

96
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,949
miraculously off the
hook for everything.

97
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:49,974
Yes, sure, a couple of
good people had to die

98
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,178
in disgrace for that. But who's counting

99
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:55,090
at this point? Am I right?

100
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:59,428
I mean, I'm sure he's
just doing fucking dandy.

101
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,831
If that's what this is about,
you can still get rid of him.

102
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,034
You don't get it. I tried everything.

103
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,107
The medication, therapy...

104
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,312
Fuck, I even put myself in jail.

105
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:22,584
He won't leave.

106
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:27,289
He won't leave because I wanted this.

107
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
I liked it.

108
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,104
Fuck you.

109
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,819
You're really scaring the
shit out of me right now.

110
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,492
I'm not trying to scare you.

111
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,167
I just...

112
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,605
Just give me some time.

113
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,244
I need to find my own
way to cope with this.

114
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:28,817
I don't believe you.

115
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,852
I feel like...

116
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:33,322
I feel like you're giving up.

117
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:38,226
Just let me stay with you.

118
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,861
Okay, that'll make me feel better.

119
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,296
Please.

120
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,035
I just wanna be alone.

121
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,582
Give me some time. Okay?

122
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:05,253
I tell you what.

123
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,391
You come by tomorrow, we'll smoke up,

124
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:11,827
and we can watch "Careful Massacre."

125
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:15,430
It's not even Halloween.

126
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,003
Since when did we start
following the rules?

127
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,977
I'd like that.

128
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,360
Me too.

129
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:54,569
Just for the day. You'd
be doing me a big favor.

130
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,472
Of course. She's practically family.

131
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:00,742
I'll bring her toys and food over.

132
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:03,345
She likes this purple eggplant thing.

133
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,714
I know. You, uh, left it here

134
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,449
the last time.

135
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:11,053
And I got food left over,
so we're good for the day.

136
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:23,165
Deletion. When you make that decision,

137
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,001
there's always that moment of hesitation.

138
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:32,040
That annoying, "Are you
sure?" dialogue box.

139
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,443
And then you have to make a call.

140
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,545
Yes or no.

141
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,147
Yes means ridding myself and the world

142
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,184
of Mr. Robot forever.

143
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,186
That includes you.

144
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,803
- There you go.
- Thanks.

145
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,272
Next?

146
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,361
Maybe it's something I should have done

147
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,930
a long time ago.

148
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:02,137
Next.

149
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,508
This is Hard Andy's pure grade,

150
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,034
top shelf, all-name-brand supply.

151
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,380
No knock-offs or generics.
This is all straight

152
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,082
from the pharma's assembly line.

153
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:50,886
You got Addys, Exies,
Black Beauties, Oxies,

154
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:54,589
Xannies, Roxis... Morphine.

155
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,024
Miss Emma.

156
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,296
She's good.

157
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,932
Those come straight from
the manufacturing plant

158
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,217
in Jersey. Like I said,

159
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,102
Hard Andy's supply is always clean.

160
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,905
Pure as a nun's cunt.

161
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,808
- I'll take it.
- Perfect.

162
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,547
- Let me get you a bottle.
- The whole bag.

163
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,883
That's my whole stash.

164
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:24,097
Then you just made an easy sale.

165
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,597
Refresh my memory.

166
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:39,801
How do we know each other, again?

167
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:44,272
Referral. We got a friend in common.

168
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,008
- Take off your shirt.
- Come on, man.

169
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,610
You just did a pat-down outside.

170
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,979
I said take off your fucking shirt.

171
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,020
See, people don't usually come in here

172
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:01,790
trying to buy Hard Andy's whole stash

173
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,758
unless one of three
prerequisites are met.

174
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,262
One, they got their
nose up some fuzz's ass

175
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:10,232
which we will soon
ascertain. Pants, also.

176
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:18,206
Two, you're trying to
resell in my market.

177
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,877
But... you don't strike me
as a dummy with a death wish.

178
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,613
Spin around.

179
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:50,038
Which leaves three.

180
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,011
Life that unbearable, baby?

181
00:15:56,013 --> 00:16:00,048
Cute little boy like you. Mmm.

182
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,518
The pleasure I could give you.

183
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,321
Such a shame.

184
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:09,324
Maybe you do have that
death wish after all.

185
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,690
What do you want?

186
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,760
I was a friend of your brother.

187
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:30,162
Mobley.

188
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,632
I mean, Sunil. Get lost, man.

189
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:34,833
Wait.

190
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,304
I just wanted to pay my respects.

191
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,976
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I should go.

192
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:48,280
That fat fuck doesn't
deserve respect from anyone.

193
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:50,883
Do you know how much
he's damaged my career?

194
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,085
My firm is on the verge of firing me.

195
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:56,655
I get that you're going through a lot.

196
00:16:56,657 --> 00:17:00,492
But don't believe the
lies you read about him.

197
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:04,496
They're not true. It's
been all over the news.

198
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:07,332
What, do you think they
just make this shit up now?

199
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:08,901
The facts are there.

200
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,825
He was working with the Iranians.

201
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,662
And I have no doubt he got lured

202
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,846
into some bullshit like
that. He's been a fuck-up

203
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,609
his whole life.

204
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,112
I just want to know where
I can go to say a few words.

205
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,314
Your guess is as good as mine.

206
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:25,450
There's no way I was gonna
pay for a terrorist's funeral.

207
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:47,940
This is a reminder that
today's city-wide curfew

208
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,208
begins at 9:00 p.m. this evening

209
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,110
through 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

210
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,546
Stay indoors and off the streets.

211
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,357
This is a reminder that
today's city-wide curfew

212
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,405
begins at 9:00 p.m. this evening

213
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:09,761
through 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

214
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:13,632
Stay indoors and off the streets.

215
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:29,581
Are you moving?

216
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,386
Are you leaving the city?

217
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,054
Please, sir. We don't want any trouble.

218
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:38,357
I'm not here to give you any trouble.

219
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,293
I just wanted to talk.

220
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,765
Please, we just want to leave in peace.

221
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,105
I went to school with your daughter.

222
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:59,778
I wanted to say she was a good person.

223
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,881
What do you want from us?

224
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:09,221
I want you to know she's innocent.

225
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,337
I'm sorry, how did you
know my daughter, again?

226
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,128
Did you speak with her before she left?

227
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,698
Do you know why she went to Arizona?

228
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,866
No.

229
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,639
I just know her.

230
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:30,075
I know she wouldn't do this.

231
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:43,088
Shama was a victim.
Somebody did this to her.

232
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,059
This country now blames
Muslims for everything.

233
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,267
There's no room for us here anymore.

234
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:12,284
Thank you for saying nice
things about my daughter.

235
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,491
That's a lot of pills.

236
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,593
Are you sick?

237
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,935
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

238
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,874
- Where are your parents?
- Who cares?

239
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:44,876
I don't need a babysitter.

240
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,116
Go home.

241
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,818
Leave me alone.

242
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,223
I don't know how to go home.

243
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:00,492
What do you mean? Just
go back the way you came.

244
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,198
- Where did I come from?
- Go down the street.

245
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,766
Take the train.

246
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,534
I don't know how to do that.

247
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:14,940
Well, how did you get here?

248
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,208
I followed you.

249
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,983
- What are you doing?
- Sitting here.

250
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:27,986
You don't own the beach.

251
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,094
Are you serious, man?

252
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:39,097
Your parents are probably
really worried about you.

253
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,866
I told you. I don't need a babysitter.

254
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,170
Besides, I don't wanna go home.

255
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,550
Why do you think my sister
didn't do anything wrong?

256
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,395
Dude, you can't just stay here.

257
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,276
Come on.

258
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:30,548
Come with me.

259
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,625
You sure this is a shortcut?

260
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,894
It's the way we always go.

261
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,797
My sister used to take
me this way after prayer.

262
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,367
Our mosque is on the way.

263
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,306
Where do you pray?

264
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,740
I don't.

265
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:57,709
You're lucky. It's so boring,

266
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,545
and your face is always
up another guy's butt.

267
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:02,514
At the mosque, Shama used to trip

268
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:04,849
whenever she put her shoes back on.

269
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:08,186
I can do it while
standing and not fall down.

270
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:10,588
- You wanna see?
- No.

271
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,063
- That's awesome.
- Can you do it?

272
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,665
Probably.

273
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,600
You sure this is the
fastest way to your home?

274
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:24,536
I gotta get back to Coney Island.

275
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,104
Why?

276
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:27,605
Because I have something to do.

277
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:30,542
- What?
- It's personal.

278
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:32,577
Like what?

279
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,512
Let's talk about something else.

280
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,014
Like what?

281
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,711
- Don't worry about it.
- Why?

282
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,673
Where are your parents?

283
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:57,076
They usually leave me home
alone when they go out.

284
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,290
The door locks automatically.

285
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:14,093
- Do you have a phone?
- Pfft, I wish.

286
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,561
Do you know their number?

287
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:19,698
- Their phone number.
- I don't know.

288
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,300
Today's citywide curfew begins

289
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,469
at 9:00 p.m. this evening

290
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,270
through 4:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

291
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:27,473
- Do you like TV?
- No.

292
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:28,941
- Do you like horses?
- No.

293
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,197
- Do you like Wii U?
- No.

294
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,300
Do you like movies?

295
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:35,035
I used to.

296
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,551
I've never been to the movies.

297
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,453
My parents say it's too expensive.

298
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:43,789
That sucks.

299
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,525
- Would you take me?
- Take you where?

300
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,666
To the movies. Duh.

301
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:52,865
No. Can't take you to the movies.

302
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,067
I told you I have something I gotta do.

303
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:58,137
Besides, there's probably
nothing good playing.

304
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,073
If your parents come home
and see that you're missing,

305
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:03,075
they'll probably call the cops.

306
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:07,746
How far away did they
go? Are they close?

307
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:12,050
- Danbury.
- In Connecticut?

308
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,685
That's two hours away.

309
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:19,725
My uncle lives there. He
likes to live by the mall.

310
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,261
He's bald. This is serious.

311
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,696
I can't sit here for two hours.

312
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:27,466
That's what I'm telling you.
We should go to the movies.

313
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,943
Are you lying to me just
so I take you to the movies?

314
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,278
No.

315
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:51,056
We're only going if
something good is playing.

316
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,765
What's "Back to the Future?"

317
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,868
Can we see "The Martian" instead?

318
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,704
Are you kidding?

319
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:08,707
First of all, "The
Martian" looks like shit.

320
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:13,946
Second of all, you've never
seen "Back to the Future"?

321
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:16,782
No. It looks like an old movie.

322
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,450
You don't understand.

323
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:21,869
Today's the day that Marty
travels into the future.

324
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,939
I've wanted to see
this movie on this day

325
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,591
since I was your age.

326
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:31,997
- So weird that it's today.
- Why?

327
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:36,468
It won't make sense to you.

328
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,869
Why?

329
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,470
What are you doing? You just ruined it.

330
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:51,350
This is the best way to eat popcorn.

331
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:52,584
Trust me.

332
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:08,300
Wow. That's good.

333
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:09,968
No shit. Come on.

334
00:28:12,306 --> 00:28:15,874
So, what is this film about, anyway?

335
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:18,343
It's hard to explain.

336
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,178
It's about going into the future

337
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,080
to change the past,

338
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:24,816
then coming back into
an alternate present day.

339
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:28,453
No, uh, you can't go into
the future to change the past.

340
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,222
It's way heavier than that.

341
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:32,190
He goes into the future
to change the future.

342
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,992
But that allows Biff to change the past,

343
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:35,560
which changes the future again.

344
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:37,362
No, no, it's much simpler than that.

345
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,531
It's about how one mistake
can change the world.

346
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:43,235
Now seating for "Back
to the Future Part II."

347
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:46,838
Are you sure we can't see "The Martian?"

348
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,075
Come on. You're gonna love it.

349
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:53,211
But "The Martian" has
92% on Rotten Tomatoes.

350
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,681
That's because most
critics have shitty taste.

351
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,202
Excuse the disguise,
Marty, but I was afraid

352
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,793
you wouldn't recognize me.

353
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:10,162
Would you mind holding my
Flux Capacitor for a second?

354
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,898
I... I... I gotta clean my glasses.

355
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,881
Changed the blood, added a good 30 to 40

356
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,103
years to my life. They also replaced

357
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,105
my spleen and colon.

358
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:21,707
What do you think?

359
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,276
You look great, Doc.

360
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:30,549
The future. Unbelievable.

361
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,651
I gotta check this out, Doc.

362
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,820
All in good time, Marty. Were
on a tight schedule here.

363
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:37,222
Tell me about my future. I
mean, I know I make it big,

364
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,124
but what, do I become,
like, a rich rock star?

365
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,759
Please, Marty. No one
should know too much

366
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,994
- about their own destiny.
- Right, right.

367
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,896
- I am rich, though, right?
- Marty, please.

368
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:47,966
Take off your shirt.

369
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:49,709
Put on the jacket and shoes.

370
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:54,039
We've got a mission to accomplish!

371
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:57,284
Hey, come on, dude.

372
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:10,570
Have you seen a little
boy like this tall?

373
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,472
- Blue hoodie?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:14,073
He peaced out.

375
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,358
Ugh, these heels are the pits.

376
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,661
I should have gone as 1955 Lorraine.

377
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:36,762
Ow.

378
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:06,526
What? Try me.

379
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:10,796
I'm looking for a mosque.
It's near a playground.

380
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,801
Masjid Al Rahman, or
The Islamic Society?

381
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:18,404
Come on, we'll figure it
out. I have good friends

382
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,706
in both places. Come on.

383
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,342
What are you waiting for? Get in.

384
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:25,478
Ladies and gentlemen, I
have a grave announcement

385
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,513
to make. Incredible as it may seem,

386
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:29,649
both the observations of
science and the evidence

387
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,184
of our eyes lead to the
inescapable assumption

388
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:34,580
that those strange beings
who landed in the Jersey

389
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,722
farmlands tonight are the vanguard

390
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:38,524
of an invading army
from the planet Mars.

391
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,556
"War of the Worlds," huh?

392
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,125
Why not?

393
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:45,998
'Cause it's about the end of the world.

394
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,833
No, that's incorrect.

395
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:50,169
Things get a little fakakta for a while,

396
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:55,942
but at the end, humans
actually persevere.

397
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:58,744
Monstrous creatures in
the world now seems part

398
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:00,290
of another life.

399
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,215
A life that has no
continuity with the present.

400
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:18,097
Why did you bail on me at the theater?

401
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,432
I would have come here with you,

402
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:21,067
if that's what you wanted.

403
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:23,002
No, you wouldn't. You
keep saying you have

404
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:26,572
- something you have to do.
- I do have something to do.

405
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:28,474
Now come on. We're going back.

406
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,949
Why did you come to our house?

407
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:40,219
Yo, this isn't cool, okay? I gotta go.

408
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:42,989
Is it that important?

409
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:44,657
- Yes.
- Why?

410
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,659
- It's none of your business.
- You're a baby.

411
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:48,461
- You're annoying.
- You are!

412
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,229
- This is a nightmare.
- You are!

413
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,897
- So are you!
- I wish you were dead!

414
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,466
So do I!

415
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,345
Sometimes I feel like I...

416
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:22,128
Did something bad that made Shama leave.

417
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,344
You didn't do anything wrong.

418
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,775
All right. I'm gonna give you five.

419
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:47,887
- And then we're gonna go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

420
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,355
Just leave me alone.

421
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,227
It wasn't your fault.

422
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:57,783
Or hers.

423
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,533
It was mine. All of it.

424
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:07,039
So don't blame her or yourself.

425
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,175
You can blame me.

426
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:15,414
You know, you talk about yourself a lot.

427
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:21,020
And you're not allowed
to wear shoes here.

428
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,843
I'm not gonna trip
when I put them back on.

429
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:41,512
We'll see.

430
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:57,189
Did you know I could be

431
00:34:57,192 --> 00:35:00,693
President of the United States?

432
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:05,131
- Yeah?
- My sister couldn't be.

433
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,833
She wasn't born here.

434
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:10,202
My mom and dad couldn't, either.

435
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:16,242
I'm the only person in my
family who could be President.

436
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,843
Isn't that cool?

437
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:23,783
If I were President...

438
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,654
I would be able to stay here.

439
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:30,923
In the house we live in.

440
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:36,228
I would find a way to
bring back my sister.

441
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:41,767
I'd put the real bad guys in jail.

442
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:45,604
And... And I'd make everyone
eat Pop Tarts for dinner.

443
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:49,341
And then make everyone be nice to me.

444
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,213
So you'd be a dictator.

445
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,685
What's a dictator?

446
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:02,254
It's like a really bad President.

447
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:07,426
- Can you be President?
- Probably not.

448
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:09,929
So you're like my sister?
You weren't born here?

449
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,398
No, I was.

450
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,335
- Where?
- New Jersey.

451
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:19,038
Really? Me too.

452
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,676
- What part?
- Washington Township.

453
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:26,512
- Where were you born?
- Trenton.

454
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,015
Looks like your parents
still aren't home.

455
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,885
You had the keys this whole time?

456
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,987
Thanks for taking me to the movies.

457
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,528
Wait.

458
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,265
What's your name?

459
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,571
Elliot.

460
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,407
Thanks, Elliot.

461
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,709
Sorry I made you late.

462
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,345
Hope you can still do
your important thing.

463
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,249
Hey, Elliot?

464
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,557
Can I see you again?

465
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,266
Yeah. Before you go,

466
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,969
I'll take you to see "The Martian."

467
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,174
It's always better to see
movies on the big screen.

468
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,442
Really?

469
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,746
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Elliot.

470
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,116
I think you'll like it.
Matt Damon is awesome.

471
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,822
Stay here.

472
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,624
I've got something for you.

473
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,632
Because you said you were sick.

474
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,577
Bye.

475
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,195
You again. What the fuck do you want?

476
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,864
You're gonna have a
funeral for your brother.

477
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,434
- A proper one.
- Okay, dipshit.

478
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,003
We're not having a funeral
for that waste of space.

479
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,771
Your problem is you never knew him.

480
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,278
If you did, you'd know he's not

481
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,909
- capable of that.
- Get the fuck off my property

482
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,178
- before I call the cops.
- I'll go.

483
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,413
But before I do, you
should probably change

484
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,916
your corporate email password.

485
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,351
Using your street address,
even if it's an old one,

486
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,087
isn't the smartest.

487
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,956
Don't feel special. I hack everyone.

488
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,125
From the emails I found,
you and your law firm

489
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,561
swapped some shady memos
that I don't think the IRS

490
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,130
would look too kindly on.

491
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,599
- What do you think you found?
- If you don't want me

492
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,468
sending them out, make sure your brother

493
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,602
gets a funeral.

494
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,140
A good one.

495
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,476
I want an invite.

496
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:17,413
I'll make sure you get my email.

497
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,282
Bullshit.

498
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,252
Got these from Hard Andy.

499
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,921
One of your shady clients
I was talking about.

500
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,704
I won't be needing them anymore.

501
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:29,658
The money you make
selling them back to him

502
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,162
will more than pay for a funeral.

503
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,998
Start writing a eulogy.

504
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,434
A good one.

505
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,437
I'll be in the back listening.

506
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,463
It's me.

507
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,499
Angela.

508
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,975
Come on. Open up.

509
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:26,982
Let's talk.

510
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,887
I'm worried about you.

511
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,432
I wish I could say
something that could snap you

512
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,533
out of this.

513
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,184
Remember when we used
to do our wishing game?

514
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,423
We'd close our eyes, and
we'd wish for something.

515
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,561
Whatever we wanted.

516
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,872
We both wished we could
get bigger bedrooms.

517
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,310
That was a big one.

518
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,946
You would always wish
for more protractors,

519
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,115
which was weird.

520
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:09,385
I would wish for a faster computer.

521
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:12,554
Probably faster modem too.

522
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,559
You would wish for better clothes.

523
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:21,030
I didn't really care about that.

524
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,098
We both...

525
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,900
we both wished we could drive.

526
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,004
I just wanted to drive away.

527
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,576
We wanted to go on road trips.

528
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,147
And eat lots of Sour Patch Kids

529
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:42,318
that we would buy from gas stations.

530
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,520
After we made all our wishes...

531
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,459
We'd close our eyes really hard,

532
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,661
hoping that when we opened them,

533
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,764
it'd all come true.

534
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,435
And we thought the
harder we closed them,

535
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,370
the stronger our wishes would be.

536
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,142
And even though they never came true,

537
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,212
we still liked doing it.

538
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,781
Because the ending was never
our favorite part, anyway.

539
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,352
It was the wishing.

540
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,459
I didn't get that at first.

541
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:26,295
You remember what you used to say to me

542
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,965
right before we opened our eyes

543
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,201
that would make it all better?

544
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:44,847
No matter what happens, we'll be okay.

545
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,684
That's the thing about deletion.

546
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,359
It's not always permanent.

547
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,679
There are many reasons why
you wanna recover a file

548
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,315
you just deleted.

549
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,818
When you have that moment of panic,

550
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,054
where it hits you, where
that thing you thought

551
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,858
had no value suddenly
becomes important.

552
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,328
Where you suddenly find
new purpose for it.

553
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,016
_

554
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,420
Maybe there are still
things left for me to do.
