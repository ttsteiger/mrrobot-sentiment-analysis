There's something between us.

I can see it.

in ways that are
extraordinarily significant.

The FBI announced today

that Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety

engaged in this attack.

00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,352
- Blackouts.
Why?

13
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,586
So they can take away
your power.

14
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,457
- The public is hoarding cash.

The housing market
is grinding to a halt.

16

- Dark Army.
They got no code.

17

They hack for anyone.

One of the best

22
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,809
One day, he told me
he had leukemia.

23
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:40,579
- They are going to try
and get rid of me again,

to not let them.

that your mother
and Elliot's father

32
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,968
died for a reason,
would it make a difference?

33
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,105
That they were sacrificed
for the greater good,

34
00:00:58,139 --> 00:00:59,774
that they gave their lives

35
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,444
to take humanity
to the next level?

36
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,879
- Tyrell, are you there?
They told me

37
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,817
you would be calling.
This is a secure line.

38
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,652
- You sure you still don't
want to talk to me?

39
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,455
- We got to show her
we're smarter.

40
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:09,857
They're going to try
and flip her.

41
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:11,727
Let me do it alone.
I know her.

42
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,496
- You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

- This gets
his phone mic live.

00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,468
I'm going to ask him
about Stage 2.

45
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:18,537
- The Dark Army set this up?

46
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,073
- They're our partners.

47
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:22,476
- It's Elliot.
He's the one with the plan.

48
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,610
- When is Stage 2?

49
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:25,481
Femtocell the backdoor.

50
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:26,682
You planned all of that
with him?

51
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,586
You're not hacking anything.

52
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,955
This will level that building
and kill people.

53
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,624
I'm going to get rid of
the backdoor.

54

together,

and yet you want to
destroy our destiny?

56
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,032
- Step away from the computer!

57
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,634
- You touch that keyboard,
and I will shoot you.

58

- No, you won't.
You can't.

It's an illusion.

that exists.

64

It's time to finally
take back control.

you said to stop anyone

who gets in the way of
our plan.

I'm here now.

That's not the way it works.

That, ladies and gentlemen,

that Mr. Alderson's father

00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,475

197

In fact, it was his
great engineering work

198
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,520
that led to some of our
early successes.

199
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:03,293
What an extraordinary
coincidence.

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,165
And now his son works for us

Mr. Alderson's value.

206
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,119
It was his

impassioned plea
to destroy E Corp

208
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,793
that presented us
with the opportunity

209
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,464
to set our plan in motion,
and it has taken

his relentless determination
since

211
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,304
to continue it.

00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:34,542
We may possess
the necessary tools,

213
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:36,212
but what we do not have

214
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:40,818
is his unadulterated focused...

when we needed him.

Therefore,

00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:54,340
his will must be our guide.

219
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:03,186

00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:10,178
All I have to do
is hack the registrar

499
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,051
and change
the name server configs.

500
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:17,233
Once I hijack the domain,

501
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:22,117
I can shut down their access
before the Dark Army notices.

502
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:23,220
- Elliot.

503
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:24,658
- I'm almost done.

504
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,795
I shut the backdoor.

505
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,865
I just have to uninstall--

[computer cuts out]

[crowd still cheering]

508
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:34,422
- Stand up and walk with us.

509
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:39,038
Do it.

510
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:42,182
[dance music plays distantly]

511
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,110
[indistinct chatter]

512
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:58,199
- Go down Cortlandt Alley.

513
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,563
- What are you doing?
This is them.

514
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:09,202
- It's them I want to see.

515
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:12,010
[engine turns over]

516
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:19,870
- [whistles]
Get in.

517
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:23,046
- We're good, man.
- No, you're not.

518
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,387
That car she's eyeballing
is FBI.

519
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,094
They're following you.

520
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,965
Been following you
since you left the apartment.

521
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,343
You're gonna want to get in.

522
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:34,083
[motor revs]

523
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:36,224
Hey, miss, grab my laptop.

524
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:38,463
Should be on the floor
right below you there.

525
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,405
Pull up the motor vehicle
lookup tool, would you?

526
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,442
Sorry...

527
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,115
about the mess.

528
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,518
Been a while
since I had time to clean it.

529
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:48,663
But hey, gas prices
what they are right now,

530
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:50,269
taxis are a premium,
so, you know,

531
00:26:50,302 --> 00:26:52,375
you're welcome
for the free cab ride.

532
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,952
Uh, now, Elliot,
do me a favor, would you?

533
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,291
Read her the license plate

534
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,997
of the car
that's been tailing us.

535
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,668
- UVM 7482.

[tense music]

538
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,624
- All right, good.

539
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,728
Uh, now, miss.

540
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,101
Input that plate number.

541
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:16,253
Grab the VIN number.
Put it on a...

542
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,492
sticky note.
I got 'em

543
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,596
in the side door there,

544
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:20,999
along with a pen.

[cell rings]

- OnStar center.
This is Debbie.

547
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:26,785
How may I help you?

548
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,324
- Yeah, I need to report
an emergency.

549
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,130
This is Detective
Robert Abernathy,

550
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:32,170
badge number 8301,
out of the 19 precinct.

551
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:34,177
[aside]
Get that number?

552
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:37,821
Yeah, I got a stolen vehicle.

553
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,396
Driving erratically,

554
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:42,570
and almost hitting pedestrians
during the outage here.

555
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:45,579
Yeah, I'm gonna pursue
for about ten minutes.

556
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,853
Yeah, I have line of sight
of the vehicle.

557
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,460
I need to initiate a slowdown.

558
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:51,800
Okay. VIN number,
here we go:

559
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,611
1, H, G, C,

560
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,621
M, 8, 2, 6,

561
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,428
3, 3, A,

F as in Franklin,

2.

566
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:07,651
Uh-huh.

567
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,290
Yeah.
Uh, okay.

568
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,531
I see the lights blinking.

569
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,210
Thank you, guys.

570
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,365
All right.

571
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,971
Who wants barbecue?

[neon sign buzzing]

575
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:36,545
- Red Wheelbarrow.

576
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,351
Did they get that from me?

577
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,558
Or did I get it from them?

578
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,363
However it happened,

579
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:44,537
it's clearly
a Dark Army front now.

580
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:46,075
This must be the guy

581
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,516
that sent me
that fucking menu.

582
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:51,057
- Do me a favor, miss.

583
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:53,700
Go get us a couple
of number fours.

584
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:56,576
On me.
Oh.

585
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,419
And make sure
they punch my card.

586
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:00,855
- I'm not going anywhere.

[light music playing]

588
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,069
- Well, I got business
with your brother, here.

589
00:29:05,104 --> 00:29:06,541
Now, the faster
we get that rolling,

590
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:09,450
the faster you two can leave.

591
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:10,922
- It's okay.

592
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:13,162
[thunder rumbling]

593
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:14,868
- I'll go stand over there,

594
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:18,414
but I'm not getting you
a fucking number four.

595
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:19,917
- What about my punch card?

596
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:21,824
- And don't call me "miss."

597
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,911
- Well, she's full of life,
huh?

598
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:33,027
- Let's get to what
this is about.

599
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,865
- Well...
[sighs]

600
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,875
We hear you've been
running around town.

601
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,552
The doc says
you should be resting.

602
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:41,855
- I had shit to do.

603
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,494
- Well, you want to
catch me up

604
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:46,035
on where we're at?

605
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,239
- I shut the backdoor.

606
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:52,890
- Now, why would you
go do a thing like that?

607
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:56,235
- I'm calling
this operation off.

608
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,321
- You sure you want to do that?

609
00:30:02,355 --> 00:30:04,127
We've gone to great lengths--

610
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:07,237
- It's not negotiable.

611
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,177
And if there's a problem
with my request,

612
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,919
you can deal with me.

613
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,327
And only me.

614
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,969
[thunder rumbling]

615
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:19,778
- Ah, I suppose our employer
will be disappointed.

616
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:21,952
- I don't have an employer.

617
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,961
- Uh-huh.

618
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:27,636
Well...

619
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,114
She believes that a plan

620
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:36,130
lives or dies
by its creator, so...

621
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,266
if you want it dead,

622
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,709
so be it.

623
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,885
- Where are you going?

624
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,927
- Oh, I want to go home.

625
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,798
And they canceled
the Mets game,

626
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,905
so I'll probably end up
working on my book a little.

627
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,745
- So that's it?
- That's it.

628
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,353
- I want confirmation.

629
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:10,507
From her.

630
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,953
[thunder rumbling]

631
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:18,902
- You know that bullet
we took out of you?

632
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,580
We can easily
put it right back in.

633
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,095
You won.
Go home.

634
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,214
Before you end up
losing again.

635
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:47,461
- What happened?

636
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:53,012
- It's over.

637
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:55,319
They're calling off Stage 2.

638
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:06,053
- Just like that?

639
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:09,030
- Just like that.

640
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:10,402
- I don't buy it.

641
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:11,605
- We'd both be dead

642
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,312
if they wanted to stop us.

643
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:14,649
That tends to be their response

644
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,591
when they disagree with you.

645
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:19,231
- And who are "they," exactly?

646
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:22,173
Is this just Dark Army, or

647
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:26,387
is Tyrell Wellick
involved in all of this, too?

648
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,062
I know a lot more
than you think, Elliot.

649
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,736
Answer the question.

650
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:34,413
Is Tyrell Wellick involved?

651
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,052
Has he been a part
of this whole thing

652
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:39,060
from the beginning?

653
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:42,137
- No.

654
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,578
Look, even if they were lying,

655
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,554
I closed their only access.

656
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,161
- You want to bury your head
in the sand,

657
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:51,167
be my guest.

658
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,778
But my eyes are staying
wide fucking open.

659
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,283
- The only thing that matters

660
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:58,457
is that we survive this thing.

661
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:00,129
We got out alive,

662
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:02,336
which happens to be
