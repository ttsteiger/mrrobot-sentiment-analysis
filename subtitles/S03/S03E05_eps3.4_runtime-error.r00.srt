1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:03,137
Anything we do,
he will try to slow us down.

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,773
As long as he exists,
he will stop us.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,309
Today is the day
I start working at Evil Corp.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,419
I can help them
rebuild the database

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,779
and defend the fort
at the same time.

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,348
This patch ensures
that the UPS devices

7
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,450
will only run trusted code.

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,420
Bottom line, they won't be
able to blow up that building.

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,323
U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,658
but this currency war must end.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,462
Stage 2, I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

12
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,136
Protesters have
surrounded the building.

13
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,067
Summon as much NYPD
as is necessary.

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,611
You know that telling Elliot
anything about this

15
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,470
would violate the terms
of your immunity?

16
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,772
I think I have a lead,
but I need to go at it alone.

17
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:42,476
I may have immunity,
but I'm gonna lose my brother.

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,079
- Stage 2 was never called off.
- How do we find them

19
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,456
and just end this
once and for all?

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,716
The best lead we've got is me.

21
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,752
Irving, he says
we'll be ready to go on Monday.

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,188
We've prepared for
an emergency evacuation.

23
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,556
We have?

24
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,225
I'll have Elliot's
access revoked.

25
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,535
I need you to fire
Elliot Alderson.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,693
Consider it done.

27
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,762
You okay?

28
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,532
- What's happening?
- Angela, why is he here?

29
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,400
Everything's gonna be okay.

30
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,336
Elliot saw everything.
I had to knock him out.

31
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,703
You're staying here
this weekend.

32
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,239
We can't have anymore accidents.

33
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,706
He's gonna wake up again.

34
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,742
He only saw us
for a few seconds.

35
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,410
Maybe he won't remember.

36
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,444
Aller Anfang ist schwer.

37
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,285
Anfang ist anfang.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,889
One, two, three four

39
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,624
One, two, three,
four, five, six

40
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,761
One, two, three, four

41
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,231
Five, six, seven, eight

42
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,737
To relay to
the Syrian President.

43
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,373
But Putin's stance
is that it would be a mistake

44
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,942
to abandon
the current government.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,745
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security
Council has gathered today

46
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,714
for a much talked about vote,

47
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,351
the People's Republic of
China's proposed annexation

48
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,354
of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

49
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,356
As the world awaits
the result of the vote,

50
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,425
many questions are being raised:

51
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,393
What does it mean...

52
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,737
For the relationships
between world superpowers

53
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,730
and impoverished nations?

54
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,637
One, two, three, four

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,739
Five, six, seven, eight

56
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,508
Elliot?

57
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,781
Isn't that your phone?

58
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,453
Is it?

59
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,456
Are you okay?

60
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,990
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,962
Hello?

62
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,273
Finally, I've been trying
to reach you all weekend.

63
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,332
Are you at work?

64
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,668
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere.

65
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,936
We need to talk, in person.

66
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,373
Meet me downstairs.
I'll be there in ten.

67
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,876
Okay? It's... it's important.

68
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,211
Is everything okay?

69
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,450
Everything's fine.

70
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,291
Hey...

71
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,259
we should grab lunch later.

72
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,579
Something isn't right.

73
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,715
Like something
slipped away from me.

74
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,350
What is it?

75
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,420
I can't put my finger on it.

76
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,988
What am I even doing here?

77
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm arriving at work.
I'm walking toward my cubicle.

78
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,562
I'm just on autopilot,

79
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,398
running my routine.

80
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,801
Did my daily program crash?

81
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,737
When code runs,
it should run straight through

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,605
without interruption,

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,843
until all of its tasks
have been completed.

84
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,911
Unless something goes wrong.

85
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,581
A runtime error.

86
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,718
Sometimes, corrupted memory
can lead to one.

87
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,920
Is that what's happening
to me right now?

88
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,022
A runtime error?

89
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,427
Yo, what up, E?

90
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,663
I barely made it past
those protesters this morning.

91
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,698
I mean, the natives
are getting restless.

92
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,334
This shit's crazy AF, right?

93
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:01,835
Is it?

94
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,737
Hey, so I had
a piece of tang this weekend

95
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,606
you are not gonna believe, dude.

96
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,775
I was unlocking achievements
Saturday night

97
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,077
that went all the way through
to Sunday morning.

98
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,347
I even impressed myself.

99
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,015
Every morning starts like this,

100
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,950
graphic sex talk.

101
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,787
Thankfully, I'm able
to tune most of it out.

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,891
When people talk like this,
they're either insecure,

103
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,461
or they're full of shame.

104
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,497
Which one do you think it is?

105
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,034
I...

106
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,836
Sorry.

107
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,508
Shit. That was meant for you.

108
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm really off today.

109
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,014
I mean...

110
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,550
Jesus, Elliot, I, um...

111
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,653
You know what, man? Fuck you.

112
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,688
I'm just trying to
brighten up your day

113
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,666
with my dopeass anecdotes,
but if you don't appreciate it,

114
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,692
I can just sit here in silence.

115
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,861
Really?

116
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,697
Is this gonna end up being
a beautiful accident?

117
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,733
No... no, I'm...

118
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,469
I'm sorry, bro.
I shouldn't have said that.

119
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,003
Spoke too soon.

120
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,139
I'm bigger than this, man,
and, in a way,

121
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,974
what you just said
actually helps me,

122
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,909
'cause I've always wondered

123
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,121
if people here thought I was
just trying to get attention,

124
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,847
but I was like, "Nah."

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,482
But I should've
started the day off

126
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,484
by asking what you did
this weekend.

127
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,519
He does raise a good question.

128
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,488
What did I do this weekend?

129
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,624
Instead I'm always just
rambling around some bullshit.

130
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,461
But you know what, I'm gonna
drop some truth on you, dude.

131
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,163
Since we're opening up here, I...

132
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,467
I've only ever
gotten laid twice.

133
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,134
Okay, actually,
it was 1 1/2 times,

134
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,036
but the first time, it was...

135
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,114
It was one of those highend
escorts, dude, a courtesan.

136
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,775
I saw her at the Plaza Hotel...
And actually, she saw me, dude.

137
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,610
She totally was hitting on me.

138
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,612
It cost me, like,
two weeks' pay.

139
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,881
I know what I did this weekend.

140
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,849
I rehearsed my proposal.

141
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,751
I have a big meeting with
the VP of Technology.

142
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,463
I've actually never had
penetration, dude.

143
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,221
I've never penetrated.
I just... I...

144
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,056
I went to one of
those rub and tugs...

145
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,826
No, wait,
I already had that meeting.

146
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,528
That was last week.

147
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,162
What happened this past weekend?

148
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,840
I just kept thinking
she was one of those girls

149
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,566
that got kidnapped
and was forced to do it.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
I was, like, thinking of
her family the whole...

151
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,005
Hey, dude, thanks for
letting me confide in you.

152
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,008
Just don't tell any of
the guys about this. Cool?

153
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,876
It's hard what he just did...

154
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,778
- Yeah...
- Opening up facetoface,

155
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,915
which is why
I probably talk to you.

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,065
Why is my account locked out?

157
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,177
E Corp Help Desk.

158
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,712
Hey, I got locked
out of my account.

159
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,280
Can you do
a password reset for me?

160
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,915
Can I have your employee number?

161
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,717
072391.

162
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,218
Please hold.

163
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,961
My work email is
prompting me for a password.

164
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,663
Did someone try
to get on the domain

165
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,030
as me too many times?

166
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,866
Or has E Corp locked me out?

167
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,768
Did they discover
my shipping hack?

168
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,636
I need to check
my monitoring server.

169
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,671
Hey, Samar...

170
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,973
Samar, I got locked out.

171
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,084
Can I hop on your machine
to check something real quick?

172
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
go for it.

173
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,946
Yeah...

174
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,916
Is this that bad feeling
I have looming over me?

175
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,318
Is this why today
doesn't feel right?

176
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,856
An update failure.

177
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,992
No, this can't be happening.

178
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,862
Maybe something's wrong
with my dashboard.

179
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,964
I need to check the full log.

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,142
Shit. This morning at 6:07 a.m.,

181
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,245
the Dark Army
tried to run Stage 2.

182
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,015
My patch stopped them,
but it doesn't change the fact

183
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,618
they're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.

184
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,021
Damn, dude, Bobbi from HR
is rolling up with Security.

185
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,889
Wonder who they're axing.

186
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,661
Mr. Alderson,
thank you for waiting.

187
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,030
I looked into this.
It looks like we cannot

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,932
restore your account
at this time.

189
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,768
Is there anything else I can...

190
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,238
Samar is right.
HR is firing someone.

191
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,340
Me. Fuck...

192
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,843
I can't leave the building
until I get back on a machine

193
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,086
and figure out
how they're planning on

194
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,912
getting around my patch.

195
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,981
Samar, I need you
to distract them for me.

196
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,249
Wait, what?

197
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,884
Help me figure this out.

198
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,286
Do not leave me. Stay focused.

199
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,906
Excuse me,
I had a question for you...

200
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,083
We're looking for
Elliot Alderson.

201
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,709
Do you know where he is?

202
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,210
Yeah, yeah, he's on floor 11.

203
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,079
You know, they have
the best bathrooms,

204
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,823
and he likes to take his
morning dump around this time.

205
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,749
Samar, you need to
be serious right now.

206
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,393
We have talked about these
microaggressions of yours.

207
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,019
I am being serious.

208
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,063
He told me he was crowning
his whole commute.

209
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,321
He was just here.

210
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,990
We need eyes on Elliot Alderson.

211
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,725
Elliot, I didn't know
if you'd be here.

212
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,335
- Janet, I...
- Great news on your proposal.

213
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,037
Starting with
the Southwest region this week,

214
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,863
all paper records
will be digitized locally.

215
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,999
I tried to find you on Friday.
I... you weren't in.

216
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,234
I wanted to congratulate you
in person.

217
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,703
Before we know it,
the database...

218
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,204
Did you hear what she said?

219
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,807
I wasn't in Friday. Where was I?

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,076
When did my program halt?
Why can't I remember? Wait...

221
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,713
- Mr. Robot...
- Mr. what?

222
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,080
What day is it today?

223
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,949
You know it's gonna be
a long week

224
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,226
if you gotta ask on a Monday.
Is everything all right?

225
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,719
Janet, I can't talk right now.

226
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,754
There's an I.T. emergency on 29.

227
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,025
Last thing I remember
was the E Corp party.

228
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,860
That was four days ago.

229
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,262
Did Mr. Robot really
take over for that long?

230
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,399
Don't look up. Security cameras.

231
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,403
That's right. Darlene.
I remember now.

232
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,773
She was supposed
to follow me... him.

233
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,207
You know what I fucking mean.

234
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,043
She must've seen Mr. Robot.

235
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,911
Darlene...
I can barely hear you.

236
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,279
It's a madhouse down here.

237
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,448
You were gone all weekend.

238
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,359
You left Flipper alone. I had
to give him to your landlord.

239
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,152
Listen to me. Did you follow me?

240
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,855
Did you see him?
Okay, just come downstairs.

241
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,398
I'm getting fired.
I can't leave until I've...

242
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,224
Ma'am. Check the stairway.

243
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,194
Elliot? Elli...

244
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,264
I'm going to get him.

245
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,368
All I know is it's been
six fucking weeks,

246
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,436
and I haven't had
a weekend with my son.

247
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,874
I did trade the car.

248
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,076
I'm taking the subway. So what?

249
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,778
I'm picking him up
from school today.

250
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,412
They cut my access privileges.

251
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,413
I completely disagree.
I think he definitely loves me.

252
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,416
Sir... Sir...

253
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,989
Are you gonna really
get into that right now?

254
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,858
That was one time
I told him I hated him.

255
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,331
I'm going to attract attention.

256
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,267
I have to remain calm.

257
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,937
Take deep breaths.

258
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,839
Be cool.

259
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,307
Don't panic.

260
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,943
Slow everything way down.

261
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,314
Blend in.

262
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,383
Look bored, broken.

263
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,787
Get a blank office stare
on my face.

264
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,924
This is how they do it,
isn't it?

265
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,167
How they're able
to watch the world

266
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,861
fall apart around them?

267
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,564
Because to them, this is normal.

268
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,067
It's all they know.

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,137
Maybe I can learn from them.

270
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,140
I wish I could see myself
through your eyes.

271
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,909
Don't you wish you could
see yourself through mine?

272
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,111
As we step through our code,
line by line,

273
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,281
debugging it to find the cause
of our runtime error.

274
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,950
What am I doing?

275
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,284
I'm still attracting attention.

276
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,986
I'll still get caught,

277
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,821
and it'll be
painfully slow to watch.

278
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,323
This isn't gonna work.

279
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,460
We need to find an open space,
a network jack.

280
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,234
God damn it, it's the start
of the work week.

281
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,070
Monday morning attendance:

282
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,547
All of the conference rooms
are booked,

283
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,075
and all of the cubicles
are full.

284
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,979
I'll have to get someone
off their work station.

285
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,313
Here...

286
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,484
She's the perfect candidate.

287
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,396
Hi, Edie, I'm Henry from I.T.

288
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,564
- Hello.
- We've detected you using

289
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,134
some unauthorized
remote access software

290
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,904
to connect to your computer
work station from home.

291
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,406
My. That can't be true.

292
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,109
Don't worry, I'm just gonna
take a look at your machine

293
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,344
and perform an assessment
to make sure you don't have

294
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,047
an unauthorized desktop
sharing service installed.

295
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,016
Well, I'm gonna
have to contest that.

296
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,517
I've hardened my install

297
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,519
further than the standard
configuration,

298
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,023
including a restrictive
host base firewall rule set,

299
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,192
and whitelisting to block
unauthorized apps from running.

300
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,094
I might've chosen
the wrong candidate.

301
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,997
I think I know your culprit,
though.

302
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:28,001
Fred over there
uses GoToMyPC all the time.

303
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,903
Let me introduce you.

304
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,646
Fred...

305
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,352
You loused it up again.

306
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,954
Hi, Fred.

307
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,256
Henry from I.T. Are you serious?

308
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,466
You gotta take a look
at my machine now?

309
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,092
I just got in.

310
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,369
Listen, I just need it
for 15 minutes.

311
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,028
I'm... I'm backlogged here, man.

312
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,064
I got my supervisors
giving me deadlines.

313
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,466
This isn't a matter of debate.

314
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,505
Whatever.
I'll be in the break room.

315
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,158
Log data from the Dark
Army's backdoored machine.

316
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,399
They're using this guy's
account: Frank Bowman.

317
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,068
He's a member of the code
signing architecture team.

318
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,170
This is what they're doing.

319
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,315
They wanna sign their own
firmware and bypass my patch.

320
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,974
If they do that, they'll blow up

321
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,248
the downtown recovery building.

322
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,311
My only chance to stop it

323
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,980
is to get to the hardware
security modules, the HSMs.

324
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,116
They're on the 23rd floor.

325
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,233
No, I haven't seen him.

326
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,383
Did he just come in?

327
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,199
Hi. How are you?

328
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,401
One sec, I'm just
finishing up an email.

329
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,588
I think that
you're in the wrong...

330
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,582
Almost finished.

331
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,251
All right...

332
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,621
Excuse me, very important memo.

333
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,790
We should get started.

334
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,792
I think you're in
the wrong room.

335
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,595
I'm sorry, you are?

336
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:12,432
- Sean, head of Sales.
- Sean. Of course.

337
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,833
Dave Kennedy.

338
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,536
I work with Craig
on the Q4 push.

339
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,106
I had longer hair then.

340
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,608
Listen, we're on a deadline.
We don't have time for this.

341
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,443
You are in the wrong room.

342
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,212
Well, maybe there's been
some confusion,

343
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,646
either on your end or mine.

344
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,082
What room did you say this was?

345
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,322
You know, I think
that's my room.

346
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,358
No.

347
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,161
All right,
let me check my calendar.

348
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,464
Service has been
spotty all morning.

349
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,199
All right, here it is.

350
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,302
You're right, so embarrassing.

351
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,638
I'm not supposed
to be on 44, 12C.

352
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,706
Yeah, I'm down one floor,

353
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,356
I should've known.

354
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,158
We always have
chocolate donuts too.

355
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,725
Jesus Christ,

356
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,694
you have wasted
enough of our time already.

357
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,429
We need to get started.

358
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,270
You know, Sean,

359
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,839
sometimes I get a lot like you,

360
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,842
where you have a lot of anxiety,

361
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,445
because of a deadline,

362
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,149
you know, where you feel
pressure, because...

363
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,418
something has to get done.

364
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,653
And then,
all of these damn little

365
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,556
unknown variables
keep popping up.

366
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,833
And when you find yourself

367
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,903
at the center of
one of those storms,

368
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,739
man, you just gotta breathe.

369
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,610
Just let go.

370
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,379
Get it done.

371
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,725
Mr. Alderson!

372
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,628
Mr. Alderson!

373
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,797
Hey, stop!

374
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,567
Mr. Alderson, stop!

375
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,635
St...

376
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,505
Shit,
I'm going through the lobby.

377
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,274
Security will force me out.

378
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,476
What should I do?
What would you do?

379
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,211
That's right,
you never answer me.

380
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,912
Is this why I created Mr. Robot?

381
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,981
To help me get out of
situations like this?

382
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,816
At least he interacts with me.

383
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,685
If Mr. Robot was here,
what would he do?

384
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,263
First thing he'd tell you
is to stop talking

385
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,488
to your imaginary friend.

386
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,922
You're not really him, though.

387
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,324
Would you stop trying to be

388
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,892
so technical about everything?

389
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,494
You know if he were here,

390
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,938
he'd tell you
exactly what he told you

391
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,530
when he said
to walk away from Vera.

392
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,332
This is a zerosum game.
Accept the truth.

393
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,000
That building
is going to blow up,

394
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,545
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop it.

395
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,737
I'll find a way
to destroy the HSMs.

396
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,373
Once I do that,
there'll be no way

397
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,940
for the Dark Army
to run Stage 2.

398
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,642
How are you gonna do that?

399
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,686
You're about to be
kicked out, Einstein.

400
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,379
So the real question is,

401
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,314
can you get to the HSMs
before they do?

402
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,349
All I need to do is get
to the ground floor.

403
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,026
Once I'm there,
I'll find a way to get back in.

404
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,919
With the security they have?

405
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,721
I'll tailgate someone.

406
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,566
Hate to see it, kiddo,
but you'd have better luck

407
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,468
tailgating the parking lot
at a YoYo Ma concert.

408
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,394
They got all their peepers
peeled for you.

409
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,662
- I know my way around.
- Even if you do get up there,

410
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,499
you got Bobbi and her
Keystone Cops looking for you.

411
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,267
You'll never get away with that.

412
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,844
And while you're busy
spinning your wheels,

413
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,704
trying to prove
that piece of wisdom wrong,

414
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,506
the recovery building's
going to explode,

415
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,741
and the people inside
right along with it.

416
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,610
He's right.
I need to worry about

417
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,013
the people in the building,
not the HSMs.

418
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,815
But there is no he.

419
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,551
That was just my imagination.

420
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,520
We haven't seen
each other in months.

421
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,289
We've been battling each other
in our own voids.

422
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,725
But at least now
I know my next move.

423
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,971
This is what
democracy looks like!

424
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,606
Elliot Alderson,
we've been instructed

425
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,608
to escort you off the premises.

426
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,344
Show me what
democracy looks like!

427
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,945
This is what
democracy looks like!

428
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,780
Show me what
democracy looks like!

429
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,615
This is what
democracy looks like!

430
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,517
Show me what
democracy looks like!

431
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,419
This is what
democracy looks like!

432
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,321
Show me what
democracy looks like!

433
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,023
This is what
democracy looks like!

434
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,726
E Corp Recovery Center.

435
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,895
How may I direct your call?
Listen, there's gonna be

436
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,764
a buildup of hydrogen
in the data center.

437
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,532
Sir, I'm having
trouble hearing you.

438
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,368
Would you like me to
connect you...

439
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,745
You've gotta get everyone
out of the building now.

440
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,979
A spark will ignite the hydrogen

441
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,538
and bring the whole place down.

442
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:46,749
Have someone look at
the battery room

443
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,341
for your UPS devices.

444
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,109
Sir, UPS?

445
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,345
We use E Shipping
for our freight services here.

446
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,756
Would you like me to
transfer you to the warehouse?

447
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,448
There's a fucking bomb
in your building.

448
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,450
Clear everyone out now.

449
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,819
Hopefully that gives everyone
enough time to get out.

450
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,521
Now all I need to do
is find a way to...

451
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,855
Elliot!

452
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,126
You've gotta help me
get back inside.

453
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,728
I have to tell you something.

454
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,663
There's a code signing
machine on 23.

455
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,817
We have to find a way to...
I'm working with the FBI.

456
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,007
After Cisco,
when the FBI questioned me,

457
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,775
they did more than that.

458
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,420
They had everything
laid out on this board:

459
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:28,481
Us, Angela, Trenton,
Mobley, everyone.

460
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,817
They had been following
our every move for months.

461
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,719
They knew everything.

462
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,497
And Tyrell, they think
he's at the center of it all.

463
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,389
Wait... wait a minute.

464
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,790
Back up.

465
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,396
This... this has been
going on since Cisco?

466
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,768
You've been working with them?
The FBI?

467
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,072
Why didn't you tell me?

468
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,141
I made a deal for us.

469
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,944
- All they want is Tyrell.
- What?

470
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,846
What deal?

471
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,652
Is that why you hacked me?

472
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,487
For them?

473
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,926
What's going on?

474
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,732
Are you wearing
a fucking wire right now?

475
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,534
No.

476
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,471
No, they don't even know
that I'm here.

477
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,039
Elliot,
I'm telling you the truth.

478
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,942
The truth?

479
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:33,179
The truth?

480
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,082
You've been working with
the FBI behind my back?

481
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,818
You've been spying on me?
Am I to blame for this?

482
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,488
Not telling her
how much I miss Mr. Robot?

483
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,590
How a part of me may have
let all of this happen?

484
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,024
The other night,

485
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,627
I followed you
like you asked me to.

486
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,062
He snuck out of the apartment
around 2:00 a.m.,

487
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,165
and met up with Angela.

488
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,736
She knew it was him.

489
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,614
I think the two of them
have been working with...

490
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,072
Tyrell.

491
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,908
That's it.

492
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,544
My runtime error.

493
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,780
I saw her...

494
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,883
And him.

495
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,520
I was standing in a room...

496
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,822
and they were together.
Angela is the one behind this.

497
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,658
I gotta stop her.
Angela's been betraying you?

498
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,994
So have you.

499
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,633
You kept this from me.

500
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,740
You've been trying to play me
this whole fucking time?

501
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,708
This is what
democracy looks like!

502
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,510
Show me what
democracy looks like!

503
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,211
This is what
democracy looks like!

504
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,980
Show me what
democracy looks like!

505
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,716
This is what
democracy looks like!

506
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,124
- Four, three, two, one...
- We are live.

507
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,627
This is what
democracy looks like!

508
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,762
Okay, we've live in five,

509
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,565
four, three..

510
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,700
Thanks, Jack. I'm here
outside E Corp headquarters,

511
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,269
and while it's typical
to see daily protesters,

512
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:07,006
it's unusual for the crowd
to be this size and this vocal.

513
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,775
An NYPD official told me

514
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,843
they're taking the situation
very seriously,

515
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,646
and sending in additional units
for crowd control.

516
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,015
What's less clear is why today.

517
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,051
With an alltime high
unemployment rate of 26%,

518
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,721
giving many citizens
something to march about,

519
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,623
most of the protesters
I spoke with

520
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,325
did give me varying answers
as to why they're here.

521
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,027
From forced currency changes

522
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,129
to corporate greed
and corruption,

523
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,931
I even had one gentlemen tell me

524
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,266
he was here to protest
this morning's U.N. vote,

525
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,738
that he felt it was
somehow connected to E Corp.

526
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,673
This is what
democracy looks like!

527
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,308
Show me what
democracy looks like!

528
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,276
This is what
democracy looks like!

529
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,112
Show me what
democracy looks like!

530
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,014
This is what
democracy looks like!

531
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,816
Show me what
democracy looks like!

532
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,684
This is what
democracy looks like!

533
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,285
Show me what
democracy looks like!

534
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,221
This is what
democracy looks like!

535
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,023
Show me what
democracy looks like!

536
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,991
This is what
democracy looks like!

537
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,693
Settle down!

538
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,328
This is what
democracy looks like!

539
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,363
Everybody!

540
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,799
Settle down!

541
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,668
Everyone!

542
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,303
Settle down!

543
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,673
Everyone...

544
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,236
Scan your badge.

545
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,138
I said scan your badge now!

546
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,018
Tensions are running high,

547
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,953
as the United Nations vote
approaches.

548
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,222
While no one can predict
whether today's resolution

549
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,058
will pass, all five
permanent members,

550
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,061
China, France,
the Russian federation,

551
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,698
the United Kingdom,
and the United States

552
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,766
must be in unanimous agreement

553
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,703
for the measure to be adopted.

554
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,671
One, two, three, four

555
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:22,274
One, two, three,
four, five, six

556
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,744
One, two, three, four

557
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,046
Five, six, seven, eight

558
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,348
One, two, three, four

559
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,417
One, two, three,
four, five, six

560
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,757
Yeah! Got it, whoo!

561
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,462
Please stay on your floor.

562
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,899
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

563
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,001
Stay away from
elevators and stereos

564
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,238
until further notice.

565
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,108
This is Angela.

566
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,077
- Blankenship.
- Mentor.

567
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,179
Walk toward the elevator
bank on your floor.

568
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,390
There's a package waiting
for you at the reception desk.

569
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,216
Has your name it.

570
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,952
There's something going on.

571
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,920
I don't think
I can leave my office.

572
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,455
That's our distraction.

573
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,023
What do you mean
your distraction?

574
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,825
Get moving.

575
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,361
We don't have a lot of time.

576
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,163
This is an emergency.

577
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,265
Please stay on your floor.

578
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,234
- What's going on?
- Ran into a bit of a snag.

579
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,970
We're gonna need you
to go ahead and have

580
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,413
Elliot implement
our contingency plan.

581
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,139
Elliot?

582
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,141
What contingency plan?

583
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:33,279
He needs to get to
a computer called a, HSM,

584
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,081
make a backup of it.

585
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:38,785
Once we get that,
we'll be good to go.

586
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,119
Come on, let's go, let's go!

587
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,821
I got the package.

588
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,455
Good.
Take the package to Elliot.

589
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,424
It contains
all the hardware he'll need.

590
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,760
He'll pose as a member of
the internal audit team

591
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,896
based out of Detroit.

592
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,464
Everything he needs to know
is on a sheet of paper inside.

593
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,871
He'll get it done.

594
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,807
Call me when it's finished.

595
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,413
Attention, all E Corp employees,

596
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,548
this is an emergency.

597
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,051
Please stay on your floor.

598
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,387
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

599
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,489
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells...

600
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,194
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

601
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,029
It's not safe for you
to be on elevators.

602
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,564
I was, um...

603
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,933
I'm trying to get
to my office on 23.

604
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,235
There's a secure room
and a safe zone on 23

605
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,437
with no windows.
I'll take you there.

606
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,012
Okay. Thank you.

607
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,915
As no permanent members of
the council voted against it.

608
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,483
The draft resolution contained

609
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,152
in document S/2015/511
hereby passes,

610
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,022
allowing annexation
of the Congo by China.

611
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,557
I will now open the floor to
members that wish to extend...

612
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,530
This is Murphy.
I'm on elevator 4.

613
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,032
We just lost power.

614
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,634
I'm stuck between
floors 26 and 25.

615
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,573
Don't worry,
they'll sort it out.

616
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,576
We'll be fine.
What's in the package?

617
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,312
Hopefully
it's something we can eat.

618
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,081
We may be here a while.

619
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,417
Hard drives.

620
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,486
Probably not
the healthiest choice.

621
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,466
Here, let me help you with that.

622
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,893
No, it's okay.

623
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,495
What the heck is this?

624
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,297
It belongs to my direct report.

625
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,166
He... he ran out of a meeting

626
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,101
and left his badge
in a conference room.

627
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,636
I'm bringing it back to him.

628
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,171
Interesting that
your direct report

629
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,206
has special access
and you don't.

630
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,949
You're gonna have to
come with me.

631
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,992
Attention, all E Corp employees,

632
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,094
this is an emergency.

633
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,429
Please stay on your floor.

634
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,666
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

635
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,002
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

636
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:46,172
until further notice.

637
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,008
I really should,
head back to my office.

638
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,609
It's actually just
right back there.

639
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,220
No, no, no, no, no, we're
gonna straighten this out.

640
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,712
Hey! Over here!

641
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,315
Douchebag!

642
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,696
- Hey, over here!
- Go, go, go!

643
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,242
Attention, all E Corp employees.

644
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,611
This is an emergency.

645
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,314
Please stay on your floor.

646
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,715
Lock all doors,

647
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,517
and find the nearest safe zone.

648
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,519
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

649
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,287
until further notice.

650
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,458
This is the police!

651
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,061
Do not attempt
to cross the line.

652
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,564
This is the police.

653
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,600
Do not attempt
to cross the line.

654
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,429
Where's the USB key?

655
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,421
Attention,
all E Corp employees...

656
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,771
Fuck... Come on, come on,

657
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,540
there's gotta be one
around here somewhere.

658
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,146
Hey.

659
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,782
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

660
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,850
Sorry.

661
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,562
Have you seen
what they're doing out there?

662
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,821
- It's insane.
- Yeah, I know.

663
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,392
You okay?

664
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,427
Yeah, I am now.

665
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,198
Wait...

666
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,568
How did you get in here?

667
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,175
I'm a part of
the internal audit team,

668
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,311
out of Detroit.

669
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,912
Was in the middle of
an unannounced

670
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,547
physical security audit

671
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,417
of the code signing operation.

672
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,591
You fucking bitch!

673
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,914
Thank God.

674
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,991
Yeah...

675
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,339
Attention, all E Corp employees,

676
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:29,341
this is an emergency.

677
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,791
Attention, all E Corp employees,

678
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,793
this is an emergency.

679
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,095
Please stay on your floor.

680
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,499
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

681
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,668
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

682
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,037
until further notice.

683
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,573
Yeah!

684
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,624
This great country didn't
start out with 50 states,

685
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,484
so why stop at 50 states?

686
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,852
And, let me add,
that this is why we need a man

687
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:23,589
with a business acumen like
Donald Trump as President.

688
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,757
If China makes another move
like they did today,

689
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,226
our standing
as a world superpower

690
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,161
will be put into question.

691
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,173
Mr. Trump has the drive,
the ambition to help us...

692
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,700
- Marlinspike.
- Moxie.

693
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,902
It's done, but we got a problem.

694
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,236
I was made.

695
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,805
There was a woman
in the CSAT room.

696
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,807
She saw me.

697
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,685
Wait, why were you in
that room instead of Elliot?

698
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,210
I couldn't find him.

699
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,912
What the hell
are you talking about?

700
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,014
Your distraction
is fucking overkill.

701
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,551
I couldn't find him in
the middle of a goddamn riot.

702
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,787
Your men came after me.
Well, they're not all ours.

703
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,589
Just 'cause we lit the fuse

704
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,558
doesn't mean
we control the explosion.

705
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,593
You weren't supposed to be
on that floor anyway.

706
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:05,163
You said you wanted it done
immediately, so I got it done.

707
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,802
This woman who saw you,

708
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,972
did you get her name?

709
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,807
Lydia Riley.

710
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,979
We'll take care of it.

711
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,214
So, you were able
to follow everything

712
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,283
on that sheet of paper?

713
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,287
Angela, if you didn't do
everything on that list...

714
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,256
Yes, yeah, I got it done.

715
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,024
Good.

716
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,660
There's a delivery man
waiting for you

717
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,528
at Reception on your floor.

718
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,530
Give him the package
with everything in it.

719
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,866
Irving?

720
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,234
Are you still gonna evacuate
the Recovery Center?

721
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,038
That's been done already.

722
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,842
- So this is really happening?
- We need you to stay strong.

723
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,544
It's like you said,

724
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,880
she can make all of this better.

725
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,315
This is a step toward that.

726
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,117
Remember the cause.

727
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,707
Attention, all E Corp employees,

728
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,776
this is an emergency.

729
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,145
Please stay on your floor.

730
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:03,348
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

731
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,651
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

732
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,786
until further notice.

733
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,766
Attention, all E Corp employees,

734
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,835
this is an emergency.

735
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,770
Please stay on your floor.

736
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,329
Angela...

737
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,433
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

738
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,872
Attention, all E Corp employees,

739
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,007
this is an emergency.

740
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,343
Please stay on your floor.

741
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,813
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

742
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,915
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

743
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,918
until further notice.

744
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:49,755
Attention, all E Corp employees,

745
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:52,290
this is an emergency.

746
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,363
Please stay on your floor.
