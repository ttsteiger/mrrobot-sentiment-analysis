2

he will stop us.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,300
- Today is the day
I start working at Evil Corp.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,410
I can help them
rebuild the database

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,770
and defend the fort
at the same time.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,340
This patch ensures
that the UPS devices

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,450
will only run trusted code.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,420
Bottom line, they won't be
able to blow up that building.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,320
- U. N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,650
but this currency war must end.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,460
- Stage 2, I want it to happen
on the day of the U. N. vote.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,130
- Protesters have
surrounded the building.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,060
- Summon as much NYPD
as is necessary.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,600
- You know that telling Elliot
anything about this

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,470
would violate the terms
of your immunity?

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,770
- I think I have a lead,
but I need to go at it alone.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,470
I may have immunity,
but I'm gonna lose my brother.

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,070
- Stage 2 was never called off.
- How do we find them

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,440
and just end this
once and for all?

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,710
- The best lead
we've got is me.

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,750
- Irving, he says
we'll be ready to go on Monday.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,180
We've prepared for
an emergency evacuation.

23

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,220
- I'll have Elliot's
access revoked.

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,520
I need you to fire
Elliot Alderson.

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,690

27

28
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,530

- Angela, why is he here?

29

Everything's gonna be okay.

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,330
Elliot saw everything.
I had to knock him out.

We can't have

He's gonna wake up again.

34

Hi, Edie,
I'm Henry from I. T.

346
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,560
- Hello.
- We've detected you using

347
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,130
some unauthorized
remote access software

348
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,900

work station from home.

349
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,400
- Oh, my.
That can't be true.

350
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,100
- Don't worry, I'm just gonna
take a look at your machine

351
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,340
and perform an assessment
to make sure you don't have

352
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,040
an unauthorized desktop
sharing service installed.

353
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,010

have to contest that.

354
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,510
I've hardened my install

355
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,510

configuration,

host base firewall rule set,

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,190
and whitelisting to block
unauthorized apps from running.

358
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,090

the wrong candidate.

528
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,890
How may I direct your call?
- Listen, there's gonna be

529
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,760
a buildup of hydrogen
in the data center.

530
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,530

trouble hearing you.

Would you like me to
connect you...

532

- You've gotta get everyone
out of the building now.

533
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,970
A spark will ignite
the hydrogen

534
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,530

Clear everyone out now.

542

enough time to get out.
