1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,168
_

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:04,320
- Stay right there!
- Don't you fucking move!

3
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:05,218
Why'd he surrender?

4
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,122
- Who is your leader?
- Fsociety.

5
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:08,593
A honeypot? For what?

6
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:11,393
A specific server, involved
in the last fsociety attack.

7
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:12,289
CS30.

8
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:13,562
You should know that

9
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:15,695
nothing's gonna come from this.

10
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:17,250
It's nice to finally meet you.

11
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:18,833
Are you sure he is good to go?

12
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,140
When we spoke earlier,

13
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,031
he was looking at me
like we'd never met.

14
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,872
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

15
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,148
Fucking weirdo.

16
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,648
I texted you the address.

17
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,203
- Is that where Tyrell is?
- Yes.

18
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:29,739
We gotta act before Wellick disappears

19
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,757
for another five months.

20
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,532
You said you'd bring my family to me.

21
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:39,156
It's gonna work out
the way we discussed.

22
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,815
Angela, whatever White
Rose told you is a lie.

23
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:43,570
These consequences were necessary...

24
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,428
- People are going to die!
- No, they're going to be fine!

25
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:49,432
Listen to me. You have
to stop the attack.

26
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:52,568
There's one last thing I
need in order to execute:

27
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,218
the full force of the Dark Army.

28
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,989
A reported 71 buildings

29
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,175
owned by E Corp exploded or caught fire.

30
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:00,576
When you see White Rose,

31
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:02,278
make sure you say I did you good.

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,984
We're gonna stay with
my buddy in Arizona.

33
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:06,332
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

34
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,351
We can potentially
undo this whole thing.

35
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,796
Excuse me, do you have the time?

36
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:15,343
Reports are still coming in
from across the country...

37
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,921
But based on the number of targets,

38
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,757
we are now in the midst of

39
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,598
the worst attack on U.S. soil

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,533
in the history of our nation.

41
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:27,436
In a series of seemingly
orchestrated strikes

42
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:28,738
across the country,

43
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,941
a reported 71 buildings owned by E Corp

44
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,310
exploded or caught fire.

45
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:36,746
There has been no official confirmation,

46
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:39,248
or even speculation, as to what caused

47
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,717
the explosions and fires to occur.

48
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,652
Officials with knowledge of the attacks

49
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:45,788
have stated that the death toll...

50
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,892
I know it may seem petty
in light of today, but...

51
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,428
I just can't stop thinking about it.

52
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,232
Keep turning it over in my mind.

53
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:58,100
"Frasier."

54
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,903
Now, my homie said it's iconic and shit.

55
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:04,974
Even won a record 37
Primetime Emmys, or whatever.

56
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,143
So I started watching.

57
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:10,780
And I'm cool with suspending
my disbelief a little,

58
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,648
but this?

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,950
Am I really supposed to believe

60
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,186
a baldin' white dude from Seattle

61
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:21,123
gets to smash that much?

62
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,026
And it's not like he was
slaying hood rats, neither.

63
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,862
This nigga get more butt than ash trays.

64
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:31,545
Turned me off from the fucking
situation comedies altogether.

65
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,214
Had to cleanse the palate.

66
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,604
And I know it only got
one Emmy nomination,

67
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,540
but I'll tell you,

68
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,842
you wanna see a believable protagonist

69
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:42,711
doing extraordinary shit?

70
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,181
Don't sleep on "Knight Rider," yo.

71
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,950
As of now, no one has
claimed responsibility

72
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:50,085
for this nightmarish attack.

73
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,521
You don't have to kill us.

74
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:55,324
You know, we can... we...
We can work with you.

75
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:57,993
Haven't... haven't enough
people died already today?

76
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,966
My man. My man...

77
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,833
Relax.

78
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,735
Calm down.

79
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,738
If I was here to take you out,

80
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,907
would've done it already.

81
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,099
Your roomie here serves
as a prime example to that.

82
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:19,148
Then what is it? Why are you here?

83
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,850
Oh, just to babysit,

84
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:24,053
to keep you guys safe and sound.

85
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:26,354
Will be tested in the coming days

86
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:29,959
as we learn more, as we
find those responsible..

87
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,894
You know, it's kinda sad, actually,

88
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,864
the general lack of respect
afforded to "Knight Rider."

89
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,100
They throw fucking gold
statues at the Crane brothers,

90
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:41,604
but Michael Knight and KITT,

91
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,272
their relationship predicted

92
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,608
the current societal
dependence on technology,

93
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,844
and that was 30 years ago.

94
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:52,047
Plus, anytime Mike
spits game on a chick,

95
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,170
I swear, I believe every goddamn word.

96
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,536
If nothing else,

97
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,304
"Knight Rider" should've
won a fucking statue

98
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,540
for his dope ass theme song.

99
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,927
I mean, the shit just stays with you.

100
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,529
Stuck in my head right now, in fact.

102
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:30,646
A National Terrorism Advisory System

103
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,815
has issued an imminent alert bulletin,

104
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:35,551
after a reported 71 E Corp buildings

105
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:37,786
were targeted in a coordinated attack

106
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,722
unlike any the world has seen.

107
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:42,625
At this time, many
looming questions remain:

108
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:44,035
the cause of the explosions

109
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,808
that brought so much destruction,

110
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:49,865
or worse, if any additional
attacks are to follow.

111
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,034
Unfortunately, what we do know

112
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:53,302
is that...

113
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,611
Elliot, it's okay.

114
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,647
Just calm down and keep breathing.

115
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:05,700
- Okay.
- And you can tell me

116
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,315
what it is that you think you did, okay?

117
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,251
Just breathe,

118
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:12,287
and whenever you're ready, we can talk.

119
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,289
Okay.

120
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,428
Um...

121
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,131
Uh...

122
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,933
I, um...

123
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,535
I think we...

124
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,470
I'm... I'm sorry.

125
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,041
I don't know if I can say it.

126
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,542
I don't know if I can say it,

127
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,978
what... I'm sorry, Krista.

128
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:41,016
What... what he...

129
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:44,286
Or I...

130
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,855
What... what...

131
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,457
What we both may have done,

132
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,426
I don't know if I can say it.

133
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,027
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,566
I'm sorry, I don't know if I can say it.

135
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,732
I don't know if I can say it.

136
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:58,434
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,672
I don't know if I can say it.

138
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:17,453
Nice to see you again, beautiful.

139
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:20,589
Hello, Mr. Robot.

140
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,159
Of course he comes
running to you after today.

141
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:26,762
So predictable.

142
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,997
Elliot said he wanted
to speak to me, but...

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,414
conscious or not,

144
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,218
I suspect that he thought
it was more important

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,243
that I speak to you.

146
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,529
Why do you have to keep
going through a middleman?

147
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:37,225
Why can't he just speak to me himself?

148
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,298
I'm not sure he wants to,

149
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,251
but I wanna help you figure out why.

150
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,887
Elliot told me he's worried

151
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,480
that you may have
done something harmful.

152
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,048
Do you know what he
might be referencing?

153
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,204
Everything that happened today

154
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,820
is because he was ignoring
our responsibilities.

155
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,558
What happened exactly?

156
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,728
The point is...

157
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,966
It's not me he has to worry about.

158
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,702
It's the others, the
real string pullers.

159
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,438
Who would that be?

160
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,473
You wanna know what's really going on?

161
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,475
Look around, sweetheart.

162
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,711
I'm not the only one under their thumb.

163
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:18,680
They're manipulating everything, always,

164
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:22,518
just to line their own
pockets, to have total control.

165
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,320
But that's the conspiracy, man.

166
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,790
So you and Elliot...

167
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,859
You want to challenge
these manipulators?

168
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,195
Me and Elliot wanted to
take the control away,

169
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:36,398
give it back to the ones
who were getting shit on.

170
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,834
We got halfway there, until
someone swiped my ideas

171
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,969
and warped them to suit
whatever bullshit agenda

172
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,738
served their self-interest.

173
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,412
That's what Five/Nine was about,

174
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:47,342
our revolution.

175
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,878
So you are a supporter of Five/Nine?

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,381
Supporter?

177
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,610
I was no supporter.

178
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:57,314
I was the architect!

179
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,121
How about telling me why you think

180
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,789
Elliot might be upset with you?

181
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,926
I don't have time for this shit.

182
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,562
I gotta find the pricks who screwed me.

183
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:08,163
Turn on the news, lady.

184
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,837
All these buildings fucking blowing up.

185
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,307
I think they're trying
to pin that shit on me.

186
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,188
I know it. It ain't happening.

187
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:15,269
So, the attacks today were a part of

188
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:17,339
the revolution you created?

189
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,408
Is that what you're saying?

190
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:25,948
We were only supposed
to take out one location,

191
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,084
once all the paper
records were centralized.

192
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:31,337
That was it.

193
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,722
Yeah, I've gotta be
honest with you, Mr. Robot,

194
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,824
this sounds like delusions of grandeur.

195
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,429
How else do you explain what
the authorities are saying?

196
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:44,266
They claim to have the man responsible.

197
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:46,235
Wellick?

198
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:49,404
No, he was working for me,

199
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,273
but you and the rest of the world

200
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,208
are never gonna know that,
because you keep happily

201
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,310
lapping up those
sugar-coated pearls of semen

202
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:57,103
they keep pouring down your throats.

203
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,605
You're buying the narrative

204
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,282
that they've been pushing for months.

205
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:01,783
Pigs at a trough!

206
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:09,091
You still don't believe me.

207
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,629
You're indulging me right now,

208
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,631
like I'm one of your nutso patients.

209
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,812
Do the math.

210
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,781
Elliot worked at Allsafe,

211
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:35,751
ground zero for Five/Nine.

212
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:37,653
He was also arrested for hacking.

213
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:40,122
He even hacked you, didn't he?

214
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:43,592
And he's completely out of his mind.

215
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,594
You add all that up...

216
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,167
You still want to doubt me?

217
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:57,272
Good people of Earth,

218
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,475
there is more up our sleeves.

219
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:03,512
71 buildings is a parlor trick.

220
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,815
Our true act of sorcery will astound

221
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:09,885
within the next 24 hours.

222
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:13,522
To all fat cats, gluttons, and honchos,

223
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,524
as you lazily don

224
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,459
your ribbons of remembrance

225
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,761
for this tragic day,

226
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,821
do not forget, the clock is ticking.

227
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,506
I think the public may
lose faith in the Bureau,

228
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,875
once they learn that you squandered

229
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:36,078
the chance to prevent another attack.

230
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,546
I'm not gonna be strong-armed,

231
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,348
not by you, not after today.

232
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,016
Then I suggest you start taking

233
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,585
- my client's words seriously.
- This is unreal.

234
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:46,321
The country's under attack,
and you're protecting him?

235
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,845
Wellick was targeted,

236
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:51,860
because of his access
and credentials at E Corp.

237
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,896
These terrorists
threatened his wife and son

238
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,521
if he didn't comply.

239
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:57,763
For five straight months,

240
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,167
my client was held
captive in a basement.

241
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,677
You can't expect us to buy this.

242
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,105
We have confirmation.

243
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:04,607
Wellick gave an unauthorized order

244
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,935
to put server CS30 back on the network,

245
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,744
the same night the hack was initiated,

246
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,613
all while being investigated for murder.

247
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:12,347
Yeah, a charge for
which he's been cleared.

248
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,534
That doesn't change the facts.

249
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,684
Wellick got passed over for CTO,

250
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,669
got fired, two days later, disappears,

251
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,021
and now, hours before the
largest terror attack ever

252
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,922
on U.S. soil, Wellick resurfaces,

253
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:23,492
claiming he was kidnapped.

254
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,028
So, what, are you charging my client

255
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,163
with coincidental resurfacing?

256
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,865
We don't call that
coincidence around here.

257
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,068
- We call it bullshit.
- Dom...

258
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,667
- We have motive.
- With no hard evidence.

259
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:38,140
But here's what you do have.

260
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,142
You have a guy that'll point you

261
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,544
to the terrorists who held him hostage,

262
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:45,881
the actual people behind the attacks,

263
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:49,322
the same ones planning more destruction.

264
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:51,453
Mr. Wellick can ID them,

265
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,221
and tell you their likely location,

266
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,810
in exchange for protection and immunity.

267
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,592
- We're not gonna cut a deal.
- We're gonna charge him

268
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,694
and just add obstruction
of justice on top of it.

269
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,797
You saw the video.

270
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,066
Time is not a luxury that you have,

271
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:08,003
not with another attack
on the horizon, so...

272
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,805
do you really wanna sit here

273
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:12,607
and continue to quibble
about Mr. Wellick?

274
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,885
Let's just round them all up,

275
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,247
Darlene, Elliot, Angela Moss.

276
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,484
Let's just haul 'em all
in here and go at 'em hard.

277
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:23,952
Wellick's lawyer is right.

278
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,487
Time is not our friend here.

279
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,155
And if Tyrell can get
us two workable leads...

280
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,757
We're being played!

281
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,425
How do you not see this?

282
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:32,160
I still think the Dark Army's involved,

283
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,862
and bringing in the
others might expose that.

284
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,330
I have to brief Comey,

285
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,332
and he has to brief the President.

286
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,167
I won't go to them with
half-assed theories again,

287
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,544
not when this much is on the line.

288
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:42,139
Why do you keep ignoring
our credible sources?

289
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:44,508
The most credible one
being in that room.

290
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:46,540
Tyrell Wellick's name alone

291
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,210
is going to play better
with them than the others.

292
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:49,802
Play better?

293
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:52,313
Are you already wondering
how this is gonna look?

294
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,015
You wanna cover this
up to the FBI Director

295
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,650
and the President of the United States?

296
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,152
Spare me the conspiracy theories.

297
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:58,688
I need to bring them something concrete.

298
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,655
And if Wellick's lying?

299
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:01,422
Then this deal is off,
and we have our guy.

300
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,158
It's a win-win for us, either way.

301
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,693
Why are you fighting with me on this?

302
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,528
Because something's not adding up.

303
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,066
What's that supposed to mean?

304
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,471
I don't know if this is
because you're overworked

305
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:18,406
or stressed out or
just under some delusion

306
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,676
that you're a fucking
super-cop, but it stops now.

307
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,248
You report to me.

308
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,049
Start remembering that.

309
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,937
As to what caused the
explosions and fires to...

310
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,916
...Tyrell Wellick and took
him into custody...

311
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,292
...Warned of another attack

312
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:38,422
within the next 24 hours.

313
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,280
...Of our company's paper rec...

314
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,360
Officials with knowledge of the attacks

315
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,161
have stated that the death toll

316
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,830
is expected to be well...

317
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:48,566
Right now, the estimate's around 3,000.

318
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,669
What estimate?

319
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,096
The dead.

320
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:56,994
But it's still climbing.

321
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:04,046
Okay, maybe you should just
chill with the TV for a second.

322
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:08,719
They're gonna be okay, right?

323
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,755
Who's that?

324
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:12,932
All those people who died.

325
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,995
Do you think that they're gonna be okay?

326
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:26,270
I'm gonna go grab my shit and come back.

327
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,773
It won't be long.

328
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,208
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

329
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:45,423
Can we just take a break?
I, um... I need a minute.

330
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,591
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

331
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,960
As you know, this is time-sensitive.

332
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,800
Okay.

333
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:59,103
But after this, I get
to see my family, yes?

334
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,639
It's very important that
I see my wife and child.

335
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,811
I'll be sure to relay your
request to my superior.

336
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,780
For now, though, need
your eyes on that book.

337
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,773
You shouldn't have told anyone, Mom.

338
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,658
I could get in trouble for telling you.

339
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,597
Well, you can't be
afraid to leave the house.

340
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,566
You still have two treatments left.

341
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,655
Don't listen to that video.
It's just a scare tactic.

342
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,005
We caught the guy.

343
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,575
Fine, fi... ... fine.

344
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,411
I'll call Dr. Zeigler,
and ask if it can wait.

345
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,648
I love you too.

346
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,471
The operation took place at
Red Wheelbarrow Barbecue,

347
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,956
it's a popular fast food restaurant

348
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,792
in Manhattan's Flatiron District.

349
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,771
Wellick ID'd the two suspects,

350
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,472
both corroborated by Sasan Nouri,

351
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,774
our fsociety video perp.

352
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,522
You call it in?

353
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,347
We're about to release a BOLO.

354
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,385
Nice work, Stanchek.

355
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:22,953
I'll see you down in the squad room.

356
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,622
Okay.

357
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:30,027
- And, uh, sir?
- What?

358
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,796
It's Wellick.

359
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,831
He keeps asking about his family.

360
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,033
He wants to see 'em.

361
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,668
It's just us now.

362
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,393
We can speak freely.

363
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,165
You need to get anything off your chest?

364
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,418
Well...

365
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,119
there's some information

366
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:32,857
that's about to be
declassified for public release,

367
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,625
and before you hear it from your lawyer

368
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,527
or somebody else,

369
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,463
I wanted to personally come
here and deliver it to you.

370
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,968
Rumor has it you're
asking about your family?

371
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,639
Yes, I've been told
that if I cooperate...

372
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,442
Your wife's dead.

373
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,611
Almost two weeks now.

374
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:56,080
What?

375
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,551
- No, you must be mistaken.
- Lovers' quarrel

376
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,419
with a dude she was banging.

377
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:06,624
He shot her in the head at close range.

378
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,291
It's nasty stuff.

379
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,762
Lies. You're lying.

380
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:14,331
Which means that your son

381
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,402
is currently being raised at
Peaceful Acres Foster Care.

382
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,760
Now, last I checked, it was
only a one in five abuse rate.

383
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,430
Decent odds.

384
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,596
No.

385
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,849
No.

386
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,518
This can't be true.

387
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,621
I know you're lying.

388
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:40,624
I want to see my wife. I demand it.

389
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:44,128
If you're thinking about
telling anyone here about me,

390
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,932
if you veer from the plan at all,

391
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,633
I promise, you won't live

392
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:53,304
to place a flower at your wife's grave.

393
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:56,140
And your son......

394
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:57,875
I'll make it my personal mission

395
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,277
to ensure he becomes a statistic.

396
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,281
Just another forgotten child,

397
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,951
lost to the system, forever.

398
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,830
I know what this is. You
sent that email to the FBI.

399
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:01,565
I knew the Dark Army would find out.

400
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm not stupid. I never sent the email.

401
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,979
How do you explain
this? Why are we here?

402
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,304
Kay, maybe he's not gonna
kill us, but someone sure is.

403
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,843
If anything does happen to us,

404
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,479
if I don't make it back to my computer,

405
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:18,041
I sent the email to go out automatically

406
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,878
to someone I trust.

407
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:26,415
I'm supposed to be on
a J-Date with Juanita

408
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,859
at Ruby Tuesdays, as we speak.

409
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,665
She's probably worried about me.

410
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,275
Hey. Hey, maybe... Maybe
she'll call the cops,

411
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,136
- report me missing.
- Doubt it.

412
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,838
Besides, what are you
even doing on J-Date?

413
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,473
You're not even Jewish.

414
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,108
And doesn't sound like she is, either.

415
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,677
I told you, my 23andMe
said I'm 6% Ashkenazi,

416
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:47,811
and for your information,

417
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,721
her full name is Juanita Rosenberg.

418
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:52,149
Look, do you think I wanna
be stuck in the backseat

419
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,651
of a psychopath's Cadillac with you?

420
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,122
I should be at home with my family.

421
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,457
My brother is probably
flipping out right now.

422
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,593
You think your brother's flipping out?

423
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,494
That guy...

424
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:06,363
slit my friend's throat,

425
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,965
and now he's digging

426
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,867
what could be a mass grave over there.

427
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,502
Yeah. If your brother's flipping out,

428
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:13,303
I'm like a Sam Kinison stand-up bit,

429
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,172
okay, Shelley Duvall
at the Overlook Hotel.

430
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,573
I'm at "hot mic'd Christian Bale"

431
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,375
levels of intensity and hysteria,

432
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,577
so please, don't talk
to me about flipping out.

433
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:25,649
Yes. Yes.

434
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,778
What... hang on, what are you doing?

435
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:34,175
- You gotta get us out of here.
- I can't...

436
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,707
- I don't know how to drive.
- You have a genius level IQ,

437
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,661
and you can't work an
automatic transmission?

438
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,330
I grew up in the city.
I never had to learn.

439
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,999
Oh, yeah, well, you do now, kay?

440
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,667
Get up there, put pedal to the metal.

441
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,608
Yeah, okay, okay. Okay.

442
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:58,221
Floor it. Floor it.

443
00:23:58,224 --> 00:23:59,883
- Okay.
- Floor it!

444
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:03,754
Floor it!

445
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:06,523
Go, go, go, go, go!

446
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,038
Easy! Easy!

447
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,345
Damn.

448
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,781
That's no way to treat a Caddie.

449
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,314
I can't just do nothing.

450
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,281
I almost went straight
to the authorities.

451
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:39,819
Oh, well, let's thank our lucky stars

452
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:41,151
you opted to call me first.

453
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,884
I told you what he said.
How can I not report this?

454
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:46,857
As your counsel and your friend,

455
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,959
I should remind you, you are bound

456
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,549
by doctor-patient privilege,

457
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:54,131
so unless he's stated intent
to do something in the future,

458
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,766
you can't turn him in.

459
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:59,322
Per HIPPA, you'll lose
your license and practice.

460
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:02,159
No, there's something
about this. I can feel it.

461
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,199
I know him.

462
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,806
I actually think he
might've been involved.

463
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,577
You know how many crazies are out there

464
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,287
claiming responsibility for the attacks?

465
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,757
The... the FBI and the police
are inundated by phone calls

466
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,853
from people just like your client.

467
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,198
Fuck.

468
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,026
Any updates?

469
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:00,097
They think the total will be over 4,000.

470
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,899
But the number doesn't
really matter now...

471
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:05,469
Even if there's more.

472
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,539
What do you mean "even if there's more"?

473
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,742
No matter what happens now,

474
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:14,378
everything will be fine.

475
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:25,960
Angela, if there are more attacks,

476
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,462
you have to tell me.

477
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,131
I don't know anything about them.

478
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,405
What are you doing?

479
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,612
Here, let me show you.

480
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:52,385
Okay. Watch.

481
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,829
See?

482
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:06,299
They all came back.

483
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,168
They're all fine.

484
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,275
Here, I'll show you again.

485
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,423
Told you.

486
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:32,492
Everyone's okay again.

487
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:36,629
Everyone's gonna be okay.

488
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,667
Everyone's gonna be okay.

489
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:09,729
Our FBI reporters say that
there was evidence found

490
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,161
at Red Wheelbarrow that...

491
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,800
Tyrell Wellick had been hiding out

492
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,101
in the restaurant's basement.

493
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:18,204
The FBI's investigating the possibility

494
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,771
that the same fsociety
members behind Five/Nine...

495
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:23,877
were operating out of
the barbecue eatery.

496
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,745
Interestingly enough,
the basement itself

497
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,214
does not appear on any
plans or blueprints

498
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:31,150
reported with the city, so it is possible

499
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,386
that Tyrell Wellick and
fsociety were operating

500
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,855
unbeknownst to the Red
Wheelbarrow Barbecue.

501
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:39,115
While unsuspecting employees
are not a risk to unwitting

502
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:43,196
customers, justified the
notorious hacker claim.

503
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:57,883
Hey.

504
00:28:58,046 --> 00:28:59,879
Hey!

505
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:02,107
Stage 2 was my operation.

506
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,050
You assholes went rogue...

507
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,510
As everyone in this room knows well

508
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,744
nothing creates profit
quite like global conflict.

509
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,646
Bullshit.

510
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:28,949
Ah, Phillip.

511
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:31,151
Always a pleasure,

512
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,848
though I am surprised to see you

513
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:34,067
with all you have on your plate.

514
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:36,990
You know damn well I'm marooned here.

515
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,492
Well, then a little bit of good news

516
00:29:38,494 --> 00:29:41,061
on an otherwise trying day.

517
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:43,230
My government did finally

518
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:46,199
get around to signing that accord.

519
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,670
Ecoin is poised to
become the world standard.

520
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:52,940
After your latest outburst,
nothing could save my company.

521
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,437
My actions were never
meant to harm E Corp.

522
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,103
On the contrary,

523
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:00,347
good old-fashioned American sympathy

524
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:04,273
will go a long way in boosting
an already surging Ecoin.

525
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:07,053
E Corp is the very definition

526
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,423
of too big to fail.

527
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:11,558
Trust me, it will survive.

528
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:20,000
But I won't.

529
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,973
So...

530
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:29,702
is that... is that what
all this has been then?

531
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:32,807
No.

532
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,880
When... when you surprised
me with Five/Nine,

533
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,817
I understood your move.

534
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,920
A false flag operation,
a temporary global crisis

535
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,922
to help me pressure the administration

536
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,382
into giving you your damn Congo.

537
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:47,427
All went according to plan,

538
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,397
which leaves me struggling

539
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,933
to find the upside to this.

540
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:57,738
Why come after me?

541
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,178
Think back on that fateful night.

542
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,952
We sat,

543
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,352
listening to a young woman

544
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:14,454
playing a lyre.

545
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,491
A lawsuit was brewing against my plant.

546
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:19,679
You told me you would...

547
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:22,049
Handle that person

548
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:24,364
as we usually do.

549
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,000
And yet,

550
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:30,103
your pet project, Angela Moss,

551
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:33,106
was allowed to continue
with her lawsuit...

552
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,377
Which put my plans in jeopardy.

553
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,381
Your job was simple:

554
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:42,983
manipulate her,

555
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,987
control her.

556
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,156
You couldn't,

557
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,125
so I had to.

558
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,890
You little piece of shit.

559
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,760
Do not forget,

560
00:31:56,763 --> 00:32:00,032
I installed you as CEO

561
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:04,137
only to protect my plant.

562
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,575
You were meant to do what
your predecessor couldn't,

563
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:10,977
and look at what happened to him.

564
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,583
And now, you will follow
every order that I give you,

565
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:19,152
including hiring your own replacement.

566
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,822
- Fuck you.
- In the interim,

567
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,658
uh, I trust that there
will be no interference,

568
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,860
with my plant being
relocated to the Congo.

569
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,529
This... this is funny.

570
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,198
That's... that's... That's all this is.

571
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,501
This is... this is, uh... This is a joke

572
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,570
with a bad punchline.

573
00:32:36,572 --> 00:32:38,038
You will also be called upon

574
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,210
to handle all logistical issues:

575
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:43,523
proper access for my staff,
shipment of all materials...

576
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:48,014
No! You give me the real
reason, motherfucker.

577
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:51,218
Coming at me now.

578
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,454
What in God's name do you hope to gain?

579
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:00,761
The opportunity to teach a lesson.

580
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:04,531
A lesson? You sadistic fuck.

581
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:07,134
You got your U.N. vote,
you got your plant,

582
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:09,718
you got everything you wanted!

583
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:15,609
No. You don't get off that easy,

584
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,978
not until you explain it to me.

585
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:22,649
You had to destroy so much.

586
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,386
Why?

587
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,657
Because, Phillip...

588
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,896
I had to ask you twice.

589
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,517
What if we're being recruited?

590
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,753
Recruited into digging our own grave?

591
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:03,023
Look at the dimensions.

592
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:05,458
This hole's only big
enough for your friend.

593
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,396
What if we're being
recruited into the Dark Army?

594
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:11,464
They could've... They
could've just asked.

595
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:14,835
They're probably planning
a follow-up attack,

596
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,204
and they need to use us for our skills.

597
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:19,156
You know I can hear you, right?

598
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,877
Even from way back here.

599
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,879
Every word.

600
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,876
Come on, man.

601
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,513
At least tell us what the
Dark Army wants from us.

602
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:39,329
Tell us what's going
on, or we stop digging!

603
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:40,798
We're serious.

604
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:46,066
I kinda like you two.

605
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:49,636
You guys are funny, in a
George-Elaine kinda way.

606
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:51,705
Still wouldn't try me, though.

607
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,707
I got a job to do, and...

608
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:56,399
you don't wanna know
where this knife been.

609
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,164
You feel me?

610
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,440
Get out of the car.

611
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:29,876
Hurry up. I'm running out of time here.

612
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:48,194
See that up there?

613
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:54,383
What is this?

614
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,888
You know why those people are
enjoying themselves so much,

615
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,439
even though thousands died today

616
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,574
in the biggest attack in U.S. history?

617
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,377
That wasn't my fault. That
wasn't supposed to happen.

618
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,079
I wanna know who made that call.

619
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,548
Was it Tyrell? What
about this other attack?

620
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,052
That was never a part of my plan.

621
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:14,921
See, kid, that's been your
mistake the entire time,

622
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,425
thinking this whole thing's
about your silly little plan.

623
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,627
No, your revolution

624
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,762
was only allowed to happen

625
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,798
'cause it was bought and paid for

626
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,633
by people like them.

627
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,643
Face it,

628
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,912
no matter how hard you try...

629
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,683
That's always the end result.

630
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,173
What the hell?

631
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:50,910
You're going in?

632
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:54,081
Uh, mistress of a senator
we got on the payroll.

633
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:56,149
Powdered her nose with some bad shit,

634
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:57,477
died a couple hours ago.

635
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,966
I'm just here to make it scandal-free.

636
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,140
You see what I mean?

637
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,643
Literally nothing can
stop these shindigs,

638
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,813
not thousands dead across the country,

639
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:18,555
not a lifeless mistress
in the guest bathroom.

640
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:20,692
Hm.

641
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:39,072
I guess they got here
sooner than I thought.

642
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:41,423
Worm-catching motherfuckers, you know?

643
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,126
What's going on?

644
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,329
Who are these people?

645
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,799
This is where we say our good-byes.

646
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,583
- What?
- You're leaving us with them?

647
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:53,820
As you know, I'm... I'm
only a chaperone here.

648
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:59,361
Well, what happens now to us?

649
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,898
Well, that will be up to him.

650
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:05,618
And I got my fingers crossed
he treats you guys all right.

651
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:22,215
Mr. Markesh...

652
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,517
Ms. Biswas...

653
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,388
please follow me into the garage.

654
00:38:34,662 --> 00:38:36,814
_

655
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,109
_

656
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:41,800

658
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,763
_

659
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,591
_

660
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:52,154
_

661
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:54,666
_

662
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,293
_

663
00:38:57,656 --> 00:39:00,443
_

664
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,124
_

665
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,183
What is this?

666
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,418
Take a seat.

667
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,120
Please.

668
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:35,965
Now...

669
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,934
tell me what you see.

670
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:42,138
Location confirmed. We're in position.

671
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,874
Repeat: location confirmed.
We're in position.

672
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:47,043
Be safe out there, boys.

673
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,578
Keep your head on a swivel.

674
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,014
Alpha team approaching
the door. Taking position.

675
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,081
Stand by for breach.

676
00:39:58,048 --> 00:39:59,722
Assault force is on the white side,

677
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:00,990
ready for primary breach.

678
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:06,329
A threat analysis

679
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:10,533
for the FAA's next-gen IP based system.

680
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:16,506
Targeting IPs in Chicago,

681
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:19,142
Atlanta,

682
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,443
L.A.

683
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:32,789
Bravo team set. Holding perimeter.

684
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,857
This is malware

685
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,194
that targets air-traffic control systems

686
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:40,530
at major airports.

687
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:43,032
They're planning another attack,

688
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:45,935
probably like today, except...

689
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:48,662
this time, they're crashing planes.

690
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:53,009
Copy, Bravo. Got Alpha and
Bravo teams in position.

691
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:02,685
But the exploit's already written.

692
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,353
What do you need us for?

693
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,804
- Execute, execute, execute!
- Go. Let's go.

694
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,577
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

695
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:30,313
Alpha team is in. Repeat Alpha team is in.

696
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,081
In the Dark Army,

697
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:36,819
we understand what it's
like to believe in something.

698
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:39,021
We're willing to die for our cause,

699
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,023
without thinking twice,

700
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:43,326
because we know

701
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:46,028
we are all soldiers

702
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,097
of something much larger.

703
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:57,273
Please don't kill us.

704
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,075
Please don't do this.

705
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:05,548
Room's clear.

706
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:09,619
Bravo team, stand by.

707
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,688
Something else we all believe in:

708
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,892
self-sacrifice,

709
00:42:15,894 --> 00:42:19,896
because when you serve a higher power,

710
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:23,699
no act is more honorable than suicide.

711
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,202
There is no greater gift

712
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,805
one can offer the cause...

713
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,241
Than everything.

714
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:39,582
Secure garage, Alpha One.

715
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:54,063
We can do whatever you want.

716
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:56,632
Please. Maybe you can use us.

717
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,844
Everything in this room,

718
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,579
from the plans to crash the airplanes

719
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:12,114
to your very presence,

720
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:14,350
is only here to tell a story.

721
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,488
Sadly, we have no use for your skills,

722
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,859
but you both do serve

723
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,629
a very important purpose.

724
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:28,166
- No. Oh, no, no, no...
- No...

725
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:29,765
No, no, no, don't give me
the gun! No, please don't!

726
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,067
- No! Stop!
- No, please don't!

727
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:35,037
No! Stop! No!

728
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,173
- Please don't!
- No!

729
00:43:37,175 --> 00:43:39,508
You don't have to do
this. You don't have to...

730
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:57,326
We got a camera, a few terminals...

731
00:43:57,328 --> 00:43:59,395
We got a body.

732
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:06,335
- We have a body here.
- Body?

733
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:10,640
Oh, my God.

734
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:13,676
Two bodies.

735
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:15,311
Hold on.

736
00:44:15,313 --> 00:44:21,017
Got a thermal. Find a light source?

737
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:23,653
One male civilian DOA on
the ground with a handgun.

738
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:29,892
One female civilian DOA
with a second handgun.

739
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:32,061
Room is clear.

740
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:35,197
TOC, be advised, both jackpots are down.

741
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,599
Send in medics.

742
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:39,368
Alpha team to TOC, area's secure.

743
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,871
We think it might be Iranian.

744
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:45,041
Alert case squad and ERT.

745
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:48,945
Got an Iranian flag.

746
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:52,114
Fsociety masks.

747
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:54,417
Paraphernalia.

748
00:44:54,419 --> 00:44:55,785
Camcorder.

749
00:44:55,787 --> 00:44:59,755
Like a makeshift studio.

750
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:01,691
It's over, DiPierro.

751
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:04,126
I know we would've preferred
to have gotten them alive,

752
00:45:04,128 --> 00:45:07,063
but at least we
prevented another attack.

753
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,444
You're actually gonna
get away with this.
