1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,090
Tyrell Wellick.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,620
It's gonna be fun working with you.

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,620
I think you're beautiful. I want to take you home.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,610
Detectives came by.

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,720
They want to speak with you.

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,530
They found a body on the roof.

7
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,970
And you both did know the deceased, Sharon Knowles.

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,390
our network was compromised yesterday.

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,090
That server needs to remain a honeypot.

10
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,690
We have specific orders from Tyrell Wellick

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,890
to keep the request as is.

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,020
There's a reason we met.

13
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,340
There's something between us. I can see it.

14
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,830
You're not seeing what's above you.

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,380
Tyrell Wellick's gone.

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,170
I wake up in his SUV and the world's about to fall apart.

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,760
We were there to investigate the hack,

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,080
and then we were under fire.

19
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,710
What you want, I want it, too.

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,930
Someone's trying to make contact with me

21
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,210
25th and 8th.

22
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,800
Stage 2, the femtocell, the back door--

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,360
I want it shut down.

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,270
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

25
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,250
I've always told you we'd end up working together, Elliot.

26
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,340
Remember the night of the hack?

27
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,210
Remember what happened to you?

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,670
What is it?

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,990
It's happening.

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,160
It's almost as if...

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,340
Something's come alive.

32
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,290
Now wait a minute, Elliot.

33
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,050
Please, we should talk about this.

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,290
No!

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,450
Did you see what just happened?

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,700
Wait, wait, wait!

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,530
Do you not understand what just happened?

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,960
The only thing that happened is the gun jammed.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,550
It won't happen again.

40
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,510
No, no, no! This is proof. Don't you understand?

41
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,350
- This is proof. - Proof of what?

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,130
Proof of what?

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,100
When you told me I couldn't see what was above me,

44
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,140
only in front of me.

45
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,360
What the fuck are you talking about?

46
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,370
We...

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,110
are gods.

48
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,290
You really are a lunatic.

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,530
You held that gun point blank at me and fired,

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,560
and yet I'm standing right here talking to you.

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,240
What are the chances?

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
I don't know. But shit happens all the time.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
This wasn't chance.

54
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,850
This was an act of God.

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,320
And we have been invited into His circle

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,740
to lead this revolution.

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,000
You haven't been invited anywhere.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You forced yourself in.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,030
There's more to your plan than this.

60
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,010
You're smart enough to know that this hack alone

61
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,810
isn't gonna kill Evil Corp.

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,120
Once they realize they can't recover the data,

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,200
they'll figure out a way to re-create it,

64
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,430
and that's where you'll need me.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,310
Don't you see it yet?

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,290
From the first time we met,

67
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,790
I felt something between us.

68
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,710
This is what I felt.

69
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,500
An uncanny connection, a bond.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,780
We are meant to work together.

71
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,420
That's what this has all been about.

72
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,970
Work together? You're a psychopath.

73
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,320
How do I even trust you?

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,980
Pull the trigger again.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,270
ll accept whatever fate decides.

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,270
Pull it!

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
Okay, Looney Tunes.

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,640
You're right.

79
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,140
There is a second stage to this.

80
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,120
After tonight,

81
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't know what kind of support I'll have.

82
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,270
I could use your help.

83
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,620
Thank you, Elliot.

84
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,160
I love--

85
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,980
Some things are better left unsaid.

86
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,880
Subtext, you know?

87
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,040
Sit down.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,990
Take this.

89
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,180
You might just be the perfect kind of crazy who can protect me...

90
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,350
from me.

91
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,650
- This his car? - Yes.

92
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,150
What time did they arrive?

93
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,020
Shortly after 9:00 P.M.

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,630
This your first time seeing the Swede?

95
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,900
This, uh, Tyrell Wellick?

96
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,140
Yes.

97
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,910
What about the rest of their crew?

98
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,620
Nope. No sign of them.

99
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,440
All right, well...

100
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,120
Let's go.

101
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
You know the drill.

102
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,000
Let me monologue a little first

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,250
and hold off on showing the guns,

104
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,950
unless they get heroic.

105
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,130
Come on.

106
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,950
How's that Pontiac treating you?

107
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Can't complain.

108
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,370
Yeah, well, I told you she was reliable.

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,110
They'll spend a couple weeks spinning their wheels,

110
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,510
trying to decrypt the data.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,150
Once that fails, they'll try and collect all the paper records

112
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,000
from the local town halls and banks across the country.

113
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,830
Titles, deeds, loan records, bank statements--

114
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,320
that's our target.

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,070
I know which teams at E Corp

116
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,500
will be tasked with this and their procedures.

117
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,330
I'm gonna assume by your funny accent

118
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,830
that you're Tyrell Wellick

119
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,960
Who the fuck are you?

120
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,940
I wouldn't.

121
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,320
Mr. Wellick, I'm gonna need you to answer some questions.

122
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,980
Did anyone see you come here?

123
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,450
Mr. Wellick?

124
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Does anyone know you're here now?

125
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,310
No.

126
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,400
Is that your SUV out there?

127
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,370
Yeah.

128
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,210
- I'm gonna need the keys. - What the fuck is this?

129
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,290
I will get to you in a moment.

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,030
Come on, Mr. Wellick.

131
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,420
My requests have been pretty simple so far.

132
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,160
Phone, too.

133
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,760
Do you know how to drive?

134
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,450
- Yes or no question. - Yes.

135
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,400
Good. I'm gonna need you to drive

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,330
to, uh, 17th and 6th.

137
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,380
Drop his car off at the parking lot there.

138
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,020
Put this on the dash. Go ahead.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,870
And leave. Make sure no one sees you.

140
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,740
And then go home and lie low.

141
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,340
Okay? All right, Mr. Wellick, come on. Let's go.

142
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,530
No one's going anywhere until you tell me what--

143
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,790
If you're seeing me, that means you boys fucked up.

144
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,510
Apparently, your friend, James--E Corp IT, I believe--

145
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,130
after he completed your honeypot request,

146
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,280
he contacted a Gideon Goddard,

147
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,780
who reported the incident to the FBI tonight,

148
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,250
and then, well...

149
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,750
Do I really need to go any further?

150
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,860
From what I understand,

151
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,690
tonight got a little sloppy joes,

152
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,540
if I'm being kind, which I am.

153
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,570
And if I say no?

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,020
Mr. Wellick,

155
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,980
pretty soon you're gonna be the most wanted man in the world.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,790
There will most likely be a manhunt,

157
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,210
the likes of which we haven't seen since bin Laden,

158
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,720
given what you two did tonight.

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,410
Now, I am your only shot at staying out of jail.

160
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,350
But, hey, if you want to try to make a go of it on your own,

161
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,550
well, that's on you.

162
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,100
I'll hightail it out of here

163
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,050
quicker than you can finish a box of Swedish Fish.

164
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,370
You should go.

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,040
<b><i><font color="#e20000">{\an3}Mr. Robot </font></i></b>

166
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,950
How long do I have to be here?

167
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,060
Not sure.

168
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,060
If you absolutely need to contact your wife,

169
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,310
we have secure ways of doing it.

170
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,140
Just give me some time to work on it.

171
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,090
No. No contact.

172
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,070
If I'm gonna be here for a while,

173
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,890
the more distance I create, the--the better it is for me

174
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,390
the better it is for her.

175
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,150
That's the only way I'm gonna make it through this.

176
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,090
All right.

177
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,790
Well, I'll check in on you every couple days,

178
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,750
make sure you're okay.

179
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,240
You're leaving? So what--what about Elliot?

180
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,400
We have work to do.

181
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,880
I'm told that's being worked on.

182
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,170
I'll need my gun back.

183
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,700
If I'm gonna be here alone, I'll need protection.

184
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,280
We own 37 acres of the surrounding property,

185
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,910
all enclosed by ground sensors and

186
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,500
IR motion cameras, wrought-iron gates.

187
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,540
This place is like a chastity belt.

188
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,150
Nothing's gettin' in.

189
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,210
You want to be protected, don't leave the property.

190
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,520
Elliot Alderson. Are you Elliot Alderson?

191
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,830
Mr. Alderson, you're under arrest

192
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,720
for unauthorized use of a computer,

193
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,790
computer trespassing, grand larceny--

194
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,470
And I would be the greatest job president,

195
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,930
ever, in my opinion.

196
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,680
So, this is your house.

197
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,190
One of your houses, I assume.

198
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,630
I've never been to this island.

199
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,640
You know, it doesn't even show up on Google Maps.

200
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,730
You're going back to New York in 22 minutes.

201
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,090
Well, Jesus Christ, you could've called me

202
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,350
instead of putting me on a four-hour flight.

203
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,330
I got a bad L4.

204
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,870
I need you to start an image rehabilitation on Tyrell Wellick.

205
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,430
He's an ex-E Corp employee

206
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,740
who's about to be blamed for the Five/Nine hack.

207
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,540
No matter how public it gets,

208
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,920
it is important that he stays in a positive light.

209
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,410
Any chance Obama goes after him?

210
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,790
People love to defend anything he hates.

211
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,650
Also, there's a new narrative I would like you to explore.

212
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,970
I need you to put fsociety's origin on Iranian soil.

213
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,090
Iran, huh?

214
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,810
That's brown enough. Shouldn't be too hard.

215
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,700
One last thing--

216
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,640
I may have a potential candidate for president

217
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,050
I want you to back.

218
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Now, I've created tens of thousands of jobs over my career,

219
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,490
tens of thousands.

220
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,700
Look, the country's desperate right now.

221
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,170
But you can't be serious.

222
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,230
I mean, the guy's a buffoon.

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,610
He's completely divorced from reality.

224
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,010
How would you even control him?

225
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,970
If you pull the right strings,

226
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,490
a puppet will dance any way you desire.

227
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,000
Right? Make America great again.

228
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,010
I say it.

229
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,160
Max, he's interfering with the resonator bomb.

230
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,950
Stop him!

231
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,200
I checked all the elevators, Max, it's not here.

232
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,530
It's got to be. Keep looking.

233
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
Mr. Wellick?

234
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,670
I'm Mr. Williams.

235
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,230
Please, come, come. Have a seat.

236
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,380
Would you like some tea?

237
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,410
I brought Soderblandning just for you.

238
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,790
No, I'm fine.

239
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,470
Are you comfortable here? You have everything you need?

240
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,730
No.

241
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,420
I've been here four days by myself.

242
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,010
What's going on? Where's Elliott?

243
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,700
Where Elliot is is an interesting story,

244
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,660
and I've been tasked to come here precisely for that reason--

245
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,360
to explain it to you.

246
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,880
Please sit.

247
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,540
First, I have a few questions.

248
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,640
We understand you were working with Elliot...

249
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,260
On Stage 2 before your bad luck. Is that correct?

250
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,530
Yes. And we need to get started on it.

251
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,070
E Corp might've already begun the recovery program.

252
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,820
We need to start our research.

253
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,570
We can't squander our lead time like this.

254
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,930
Four days is already too long.

255
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,670
Yes, well, uh...

256
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,630
before we commit our resources to you,

257
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,730
I was sent here

258
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,770
to confirm your loyalty to our cause.

259
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,880
This is something we take very seriously

260
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
if we're to work with someone at this level.

261
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,150
You mean the Dark Army?

262
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,990
Of course I will be loyal to you.

263
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,870
You're our partners--

264
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,350
Did you kill Sharon Knowles?

265
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,440
What?

266
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,310
Did you kill Sharon Knowles?

267
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm not sure I understand.

268
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,300
Don't look away. Look at me.

269
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,840
Did you kill Sharon Knowles?

270
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
What does this have to do with--

271
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,570
- Did you kill Sharon Knowles? - No.

272
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,610
- Do you love your wife? - What is this?

273
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,430
- Do you love your wife? - Of course I do!

274
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,400
Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?

275
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,260
Don't look away. Look at me.

276
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,620
Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?

277
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,460
- No. - Will you be loyal to me?

278
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,320
- Yes. - Were you fired from E Corp?

279
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,350
No, I quit.

280
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,700
Are you afraid of becoming your father?

281
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,410
What?

282
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,500
- Do you hate your father? - No.

283
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,440
- Will you be loyal to me? - Yes.

284
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,060
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?

285
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,060
This is enough!

286
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,650
- Did you murder Sharon Knowles? - I said no!

287
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,850
- Do you hate your father? - No.

288
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,370
- Do you love your wife? - Of course I do.

289
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,330
- Were you fired? - No.

290
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,290
- Will you be loyal to me? - Yes!

291
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,720
Don't look away. Look at me. Do you hate your father?

292
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,860
- Are you afraid of becoming your father? - This is enough.

293
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,480
- Were you fired from E Corp? - This is enough!

294
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,730
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?

295
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,050
- Will you be loyal to me? - Yes!

296
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,360
Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?

297
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,160
Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?

298
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,080
Yes.

299
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,320
Have you ever cheated on your wife?

300
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,790
No.

301
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,300
Do you hate your father?

302
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,640
Yeah.

303
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,000
Were you fired from E Corp?

304
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,100
Yeah.

305
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,250
Are you afraid of becoming your father?

306
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,830
Yes.

307
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,270
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?

308
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,310
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?

309
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,360
Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,310
Will you be loyal to me?

311
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,720
No, I will not.

312
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,030
I will not.

313
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,480
But I will always be loyal to Elliot.

314
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,390
You'll need to prep Stage 2 from here

315
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,490
until we establish a more permanent headquarters.

316
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,330
We'll get you everything you need to begin reconnaissance.

317
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,150
You'll receive a phone and a laptop

318
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,120
with a VSAT to a satellite that we control.

319
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,920
Further instructions will follow.

320
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,600
We're naming this op Red Wheelbarrow.

321
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,440
It was Mr. Alderson's request.

322
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,900
But you still haven't told me...

323
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,990
Where is Elliot?

324
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,120
You have a collect call from an inmate

325
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,140
at the Queensboro Correctional Facility.

326
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,350
This call will be recorded and monitored.

327
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,100
Please press one to accept.

328
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,580
Hello?

329
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,360
Is it really you?

330
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,110
Who is this?

331
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,690
Bonsoir, Elliot.

332
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,530
"Death Likes It Hot" by Gore Vida--Chapter one.

333
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,620
The death of Peaches Sandoe, the midget,

334
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,210
at the hands, or rather feet--

335
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,480
In the sideshow of the circus at Madison Square Garden...

336
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,740
You seem frustrated.

337
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,420
It was Elliot. He was acting strange.

338
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,000
Doesn't exactly floor me.

339
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,480
Come outside with me for a moment.

340
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,660
Get a firm stance.

341
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,710
Solid grip.

342
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,510
Swing through the log!

343
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,950
I need to get back to work.

344
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,100
You know, if you're not careful,

345
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,130
you can lose your mind up here alone.

346
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,480
This is the best way to get you centered.

347
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,250
Balance is key.

348
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,480
Let me walk you through another one.

349
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,630
I used to do it as a child.

350
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,700
Why'd you ever stop?

351
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,920
Because I hated it.

352
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,330
Even better.

353
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,550
Here's the femtocell.

354
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,830
The malware's already installed.

355
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,570
Just need you to mod it and do your thing with the antennas.

356
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,780
Cool. I'll hit this up tonight.

357
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,460
Tonight?

358
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,030
Try now, kid. We're on a schedule.

359
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,000
We have some worrywarts back at the house.

360
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,470
Training Angela for this hack has been a bitch.

361
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,870
What's up? You're acting weird.

362
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,250
You ever think about not doing this shit anymore?

363
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,310
Just giving it up?

364
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,550
I mean, can't we just be a normal couple

365
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,450
that complains about the water bill

366
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,130
and looks up vacation packages to

367
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,180
Budapest?

368
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,670
I knew I should've never let you fuck me.

369
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,340
- Okay. - I'm joking, dickface.

370
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,740
Look, we're in the eye of a shitstorm,

371
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,490
and it ain't slowing down right now.

372
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,770
But it will.

373
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,880
Maybe then we can discuss Budapest.

374
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,040
She's antsy for it, so...

375
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,130
make sure you get it back to me soon.

376
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,360
She's a job.

377
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,100
Always was.

378
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,370
If anything gets fucked up,

379
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,240
she's protected, you're not.

380
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,790
Why are you telling me this?

381
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,720
Stop caring about her.

382
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,290
Trust me.

383
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,730
Bye.

384
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,340
That thing needs to go back to the city, ASAP.

385
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,350
There's additional code on here.

386
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,450
The Android malware--

387
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,720
this has nothing to do with our plan.

388
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,160
Why am I even discussing this with you?

389
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,130
Elliot and I should be working on this together.

390
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,890
If we were in the same room, this would've been done.

391
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,330
Are you finished?

392
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,500
How you holding up?

393
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,770
Thought this might cheer you up.

394
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,620
Help remind you of the old country.

395
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,840
Swedish Fish.

396
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,010
I take it you've read the news of your wife's divorce.

397
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,730
Listen...

398
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,340
don't believe everything you read, okay?

399
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,430
Those tabloids-they're always full of shit.

400
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,980
Look how they almost ruined Richard Gere's life,

401
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,380
and he's a damn fine actor.

402
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,890
"Primal Fear," Am I right?

403
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,750
No one who's been emasculated by crushing or cutting

404
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,180
may enter the assembly of the Lord--

405
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,400
Deuteronomy 23:1.

406
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,600
Thanks for getting me the sunglasses.

407
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,750
Freeze! Don't move!

408
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,800
Let me see your hands.

409
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,860
Hands in the air, now!

410
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,810
Yep, I'm looking at him right now.

411
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,070
Yes, sir.

412
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,250
I have the coordinates plugged into my GPS.

413
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,590
I should be there in about an hour.

414
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,260
Yes, sir. U-FAP. We'll keep this on lockdown.

415
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,680
Okay, Mr. Wellick, I need to let you know

416
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,830
that you're being detained locally by me

417
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,900
for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

418
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,060
I'll be transferring you to FBI custody,

419
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,680
where you'll be federally charged.

420
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,120
I can't believe it's actually you.

421
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,060
I just had a hunch.

422
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,550
Do you speak English?

423
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,580
You just got me a promotion, you know that?

424
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,020
Before the FBI takes you away, I got to get a selfie with you.

425
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,990
No one's gonna believe this.

426
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,280
You all right?

427
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,760
Finally.

428
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,030
I was thinking you guys were gonna send the cavalry.

429
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,100
You guys and your goddamn cute puzzles.

430
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,290
I could've gotten here sooner if you just gave me the address.

431
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,470
I had to solve a fucking math problem to figure it out.

432
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,730
You're lucky I covered the area

433
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,550
and made sure all the leads on Wellick came directly to me.

434
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,320
But I wasn't planning on killing a fucking cop.

435
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,320
What if he had called it in to the local Barney Fife?

436
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,950
I mean, if you had done your job--

437
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,620
You got to understand where I'm coming from.

438
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,490
Now, I am getting some serious heat at work,

439
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,800
which in my world eventually leads to suspicion--

440
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,930
suspicion because of the events you guys created.

441
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,200
I dodged a shootout in China.

442
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,340
That hasn't gone unnoticed.

443
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
Why was there a shootout?

444
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,350
Who the fuck knows? Because your boss is a maniac.

445
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,530
And now, with this FBI hack,

446
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,140
it's left us in a shitstorm over Berenstain.

447
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,150
Shit happens.

448
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,650
Today wasn't our best day, but we took care of it.

449
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,870
"We"?

450
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,890
I took care of it.

451
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,810
Yeah. Right. I forgot.

452
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,210
You guys don't give a shit about me.

453
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,630
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

454
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,060
You fucking weirdo.

455
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,060
Hey, don't mind him.

456
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,550
He's a little snake--

457
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,330
you know, the kind of guy

458
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
that will slice your throat when you fart.

459
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,630
So...

460
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,280
you want to tell me what that was all about--

461
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,450
running off like that?

462
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,120
You and I--our stories aren't that different.

463
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,100
I'm not wanted for the crime of the century.

464
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,500
I work a little more subtly.

465
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,180
But we're both married to our jobs...

466
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,550
Whether by nature or by choice.

467
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,290
That said...

468
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,580
my boys were everything to me.

469
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,230
Problem is, I fucked up.

470
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,090
Took too long to realize it.

471
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
And when my wife left me,

472
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,470
she took 'em.

473
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,330
- What happened? - I was lost--

474
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,230
as lost as you are right now.

475
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,050
And after chopping a fuckload of wood myself,

476
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,590
I realized I needed them in my life.

477
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,510
But I knew I had to have a lot of patience.

478
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,820
And when the time was right...

479
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,590
I was able to prove to my wife that I was a good provider...

480
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,810
a good father,

481
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,490
a good man.

482
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,590
Now, tonight,

483
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,070
when I get home, my kids are gonna run up and hug me.

484
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,540
We're gonna make Jiffy Pop

485
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,230
and watch "Big Brother" together.

486
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,400
When all is said and done here,

487
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,420
you'll have your chance to fix your situation.

488
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,840
And then your wife and son

489
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,160
will come running up to greet you

490
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,250
at the end of a long day's work.

491
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,570
My wife has to see me as someone strong again.

492
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,400
She has to know I will fix this.

493
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,960
But we have to get this mission back on track.

494
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,510
And that can't happen until Elliot and I are reunited.

495
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,350
Give me a few more weeks,

496
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,460
and I promise...

497
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,790
you'll see him.

498
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,350
- Couldn't close? - Nah, he walked.

499
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,730
What happened?

500
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,180
I'll tell you what happened.

501
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,860
You couldn't relate to him.

502
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,300
Take my thermos, for example.

503
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,670
Yeah, so what? You don't even have kids.

504
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,640
Point is, people want a connection.

505
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,740
Makes you more trustworthy.

506
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,350
You walk around with one of these,

507
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,740
and all of a sudden, you're that corny guy

508
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,150
who's proud of being a father,

509
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,920
helps them buy what you're selling.

510
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,750
Yeah. I'm gonna go in for the night.

511
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,860
Next time, make the sale.

512
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,460
So how'd it go?

513
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,540
It was cool.

514
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,680
Got to stab up a bunch of neo-Nazi motherfuckers to death.

515
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,230
You know, not that I'm a fan of murderin' and shit,

516
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,040
'cause I respect life and all,

517
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,060
but when it come to neo-Nazis...

518
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,640
Well, shit,

519
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,830
not gonna lie-- it was kind of fun.

520
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,530
I mean how'd it go with Alderson?

521
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,900
He got his papers.

522
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,970
Should be out soon.

523
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,810
By the way, get him laid when he gets out, man.

524
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,870
Homeboy is wound tighter than a chinchilla's asshole.

525
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,710
Go get packed.

526
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,840
He's being released.

527
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,600
It's perfect. He will love it.

528
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,980
Now, I'm giving this back to you

529
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,590
for safe keeping.

530
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,630
The barrel was jammed. Squib load.

531
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,320
Next shot would've blown your hand clean off.

532
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,870
Lucky for you, I took care of it.

533
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,320
So this is how the meet's gonna go down.

534
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,770
We've reached out to Elliot,

535
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,190
and you will be given further instructions

536
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,050
as soon as he makes contact.

537
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,500
Until then, we're gonna need you to stay here

538
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,630
so you'll be near the rendezvous point.

539
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,070
Now, you'll give our driver the address.

540
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,300
He won't know where you're going until you tell him.

541
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,220
If you get hungry, just call for room service.

542
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,700
Oh, stay away from the windows, okay?

543
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,340
We can't take any chances now that we're in the city.

544
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,870
- Okay. - Wait.

545
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,850
What about my suit?

546
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,990
- Tyrell, we discussed this. - I need it.

547
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,460
It's nonnegotiable.

548
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,060
I have to look my best for him.

549
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,490
It's in your closet.

550
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,520
I still strongly advise against wearing it.

551
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,640
You know, this isn't bumfuck nowhere.

552
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,490
You get picked up around here,

553
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,290
we can't protect you.

554
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,290
Mr. Willick, it sounds like someone's here downstairs.

555
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:28,570
I'll be right down.

556
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,800
- You Elliot? - How do you know my name?

557
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,040
No Elliot?

558
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,210
No, no, okay. Wait.

559
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,300
Chambers and Church.

560
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,900
We have to be careful now.

561
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,840
They said he's going to be okay.

562
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,980
You need to sit down.

563
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,530
When he wakes up, you shouldn't talk to him.

564
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,960
I will handle this.

565
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,740
He should be in a hospital.

566
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,580
The conditions here aren't suitable.

567
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,970
- It's--it's-- - He's in good hands.

568
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,210
I don't understand.

569
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,120
I don't understand.

570
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,100
He and I were meant to be a team,

571
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,070
but he kept saying I wasn't real.

572
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,570
He said he didn't see me,

573
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,110
but I was standing right in front of him.

574
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,400
We were talking.

575
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,600
So why would he say I wasn't real, hmm?

576
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,180
I don't understand.

577
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,880
I just don't understand.

578
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,240
It was almost as if he were a different person.

579
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,410
Tyrell...

580
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,160
- He is-- - Tyrell.

581
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,460
There's something that I need to tell you about Elliot.

582
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,990
You're right.

583
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,900
He sometimes can become a different person.
