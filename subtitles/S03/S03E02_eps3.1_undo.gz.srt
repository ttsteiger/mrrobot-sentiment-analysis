1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,656
- Hello?
- Bonsoir, Elliot.

2
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:04,375
- _
- They're planning something.

3
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:08,038
17 of 71 facilities
around the country so far.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,940
This is where the
paper records are going.

5
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,875
Elliot, what is Stage 2?

6
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:14,804
The femtocell was to get
access to their UPS's.

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,381
They're trying to blow up
Evil Corp's recovery building.

8
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:20,050
I don't play fair. I play what I want.

9
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,726
_

10
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:24,255
- I invoke my Fifth Amendment...
- You're an enemy combatant.

11
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,257
You don't have any rights.

12
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,691
One of your patients hacked me.

13
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,343
He stole my dog on top of it.

14
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:30,489
_

15
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,242
The phone call... make me understand.

16
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,764
I wanted you to feel what I felt.

17
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,250
- You pussy.
- You...

18
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,965
This fucker thinks he can hurt my girl!

19
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:40,200
If you're serious about

20
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:41,257
- punishing him...
- I am.

21
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,101
- Just tell me what to do.
- The E Corp party.

22
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,953
When you saw Scott, he was disheveled.

23
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:47,377
- Yeah, but Joanna...
- Tell the cops your story.

24
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,014
Scott Knowles intimidated
you. This is how we punish him.

25
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,682
That ever-looming presence

26
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,051
that is Mr. Robot, I don't feel it.

27
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,086
Is it possible that
the bullet killed him...

28
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:57,788
And not me?

29
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,177
I need to find a way to fix what I did.

30
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,974
I need a job at Evil Corp.

31
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,738
You know when you fuck something up

32
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,907
and you wish you had
the power to hit "undo"?

33
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,413
Like when you say the dumbest thing

34
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,515
in front of your biggest crush.

35
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,687
Or when you talk shit
about your boss in an email,

36
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,256
then hit "reply all"
to everyone at work.

37
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,326
Or when you crash the
entire world economy

38
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,628
and kick-start the inevitable downfall

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,830
of human civilization?

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,716
We all have those days.

41
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,771
But today is not gonna be one of them.

42
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,445
Because today

43
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,580
I found a way to hit "undo".

44
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,619
Today is the day I start
working at Evil Corp.

45
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,271
Hello. I'm Linda,

46
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:08,125
Chief Human Resources
Officer here at Evil Corp.

47
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,896
Evil Corp is, well, evil.

48
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,731
That much I thought, but
what I didn't realize was

49
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,432
maybe they're a necessary evil

50
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,568
that just needs to be kept in check.

51
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,670
In fact, maybe calling them evil

52
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,693
was just my dorm room
philosophizing run amuck.

53
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,576
I'd like to say welcome
to the Evil Corp family.

54
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,244
We're happy to have you here.

55
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,146
But this doesn't mean I'm selling out.

56
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,693
I'm just growing up.

57
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:32,750
Signing up for a 401K,

58
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,519
choosing an HMO plan
with a good deductible.

59
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,159
Sign up for Trunk Club.

60
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,558
Pop a few Zoloft.

61
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,995
Join in on the live-action cartoon

62
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,731
of 2D emotions that everyone else is in.

63
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,068
I finally see the fatal
exception error of my ways,

64
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,836
and I know what to do now.

65
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,573
I'm gonna fix the world I broke,

66
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:57,341
and put it back together
better than it was before.

67
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,405
Let's talk about your crucial
role here at Evil Corp.

68
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:02,679
I'm gonna undo the hack.

69
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,416
Now, I can't decrypt
the data I fucked up,

70
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,663
that much is true.

71
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,919
But since I'm working
on the recovery team,

72
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,654
I can help them rebuild the database

73
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,777
and defend the fort at the same time.

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,082
There's a little talent
roaming around on this floor,

75
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,829
but the primo poon is on floor 31.

76
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,231
As of last week, it looks
like Tyrell was right.

77
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,534
Evil Corp has delivered
their paper records

78
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,771
from 17 of their 71 buildings
to their New York facility.

79
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,707
Pretty sure she would cheat
on her fiance for me, man.

80
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,144
She really... like, the way she
looks at me, dude, it's like,

81
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,046
slippery when wet, am I right?

82
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,882
But lucky for them, now they've got me.

83
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,892
Our current plan is deeply flawed

84
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,072
and massively inefficient.

85
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,107
This is William.

86
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,958
He's my technology manager.

87
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,567
If I can convince him
to convince his boss

88
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,902
to convince his boss
to convince her boss

89
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,671
to digitize all the paper records

90
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,339
in their local facilities

91
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,619
instead of shipping them here, then...

92
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,877
We can avoid a single point of failure.

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,378
We would install hardware and softw...

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,933
Elliot, I hear your passion,

95
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:12,023
but I got tickets to the
Goo Goo Dolls reunion concert

96
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,584
tonight, so let's wrap this up. Okay?

97
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,889
His password was pretty easy
to figure out after that.

98
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,124
After going through his emails,

99
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,093
I quickly learned that he
was having the engineers

100
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:26,263
install rootkits on all
of Evil Corp's phones,

101
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,233
so they can illegally
sell private consumer data.

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,570
I tipped off the FBI,

103
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,206
got him arrested, and
promptly set a meeting

104
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,275
with the next exec up the chain.

105
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,254
But meetings can take forever to set.

106
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,990
So in the meantime, I
had to look for a stopgap.

107
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,825
In this case, E Shipping,

108
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,793
their shipping management console.

109
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:59,665
Wait a minute, this ain't right.

110
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:02,099
All our shipments are
supposed to go to New York.

111
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,569
The paper says "Sioux
Falls, South Dakota."

112
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,572
Yeah, you're in Sioux Falls, Earl,

113
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,808
which sure as shit don't make no sense.

114
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,078
But all right. Unpack her, boys!

115
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm sending shipping requests

116
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,649
to the actual facilities,

117
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,751
but in the manifest,
I'm making it look like

118
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,922
all the paper's still
arriving in New York.

119
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,289
It'll take a while, but I
just need to buy enough time

120
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,958
until I can prove my
case to upper management.

121
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,302
By eliminating physical paper delivery,

122
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,003
we can cut E Shipping cost,

123
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,172
installing hardware and software at...

124
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,226
Elliot, you are ambitious,
I'll give you that,

125
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,086
but I got a SoulCycle
class I'm late for.

126
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,148
Let's pick this up
sometime next quarter?

127
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,503
Hacking Peter was as
easy as watching him.

128
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,689
I felt bad taking him down,

129
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,024
until I saw that he
had his engineering team

130
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,126
use special software to help E Corp's

131
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,597
auto manufacturing partners
cheat the emissions test

132
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,266
to hide how much pollution
they really created.

133
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,338
Factoring in the
bureaucracy and the line of

134
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,040
corrupt, moronic managers
I have to get through,

135
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,642
I'll need to keep up the illusion that

136
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,377
shipments are still happening.

137
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,347
These are the same damn
boxes you brought last week.

138
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,550
You know me. I do what the paper says.

139
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,852
All right!

140
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,454
Pack it up, boys!

141
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,155
Problem with my illusion is,

142
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,991
what if Tyrell and the Dark Army

143
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,892
think all the records
actually get there?

144
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,895
This is why I gotta keep
the UPS systems safe too,

145
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:41,465
because these innocuous backup batteries

146
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,090
in the New York facility

147
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:46,069
can turn into idle bombs
with the right malware.

148
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,005
And these are the frontline soldiers

149
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,940
trusted to protect them.

150
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,242
You guys gonna stop me?
Uh, I'm a bloodhound, girl.

151
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,211
I just dove right back
in, dude, just... ah.

152
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,180
This patch ensures that the UPS devices

153
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,882
will only run trusted code

154
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,385
that's digitally signed by Evil Corp.

155
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,286
Bottom line: even if they think

156
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,155
all the paper records got here,

157
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,324
they won't be able to
blow up that building.

158
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,069
In conclusion, digitizing locally

159
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,316
and not shipping paper records here

160
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,408
is the best option for
our recovery efforts.

161
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,355
Perfect.

162
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,957
Let's set a meeting with
the VP of Technology.

163
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,993
I want to get this in front of him.

164
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,063
Great work, Elliot.

165
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,905
Once upper management's on board,

166
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,240
we'll be on our way to
rebuilding the database

167
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,932
and the hack will
officially be behind us.

168
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:02,612
Doesn't mean that in
my spare time I can't

169
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,849
find ways to purge Evil
Corp of all their shitbags.

170
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,952
You know, your typical
subprime mortgage scammers,

171
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,220
Ponzi schemers...

172
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,588
Pension embezzlers,

173
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,151
and sexual harassers.

174
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:15,592
That way, when Evil Corp
gets back on its feet,

175
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:16,827
they'll no longer be evil.

176
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,228
We're proud to call you

177
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,063
a new member of Evil... E Corp.

178
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,439
Because changing the world

179
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,333
was never about tearing E Corp down.

180
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,302
It's about making them better.

181
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,672
Maybe I fucked up an
already fucked-up world,

182
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,074
but I'm fixing it now, hitting "undo."

183
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,350
And, friend, it feels great.

184
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:40,624

185
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,451
Okay, if I'm being real,

186
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,287
I haven't fixed everything.

187
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,899
The loneliness came back.

188
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,902
Worse than I remember.

189
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,913
I don't get it.

190
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,482
I know I'm doing the right thing.

191
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,887
You have to see that.

192
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,987
Then what is this?

193
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,723
Why do I feel this empty void inside?

194
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,164
Even the Zoloft isn't helping.

195
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,134
I don't know what to do.

196
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:09,472
Fuck.

197
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:11,241
What's wrong with me?

198
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,578
I'm really starting to lose it.

199
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,417
With everything going on,
my landlord at the office

200
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,753
hasn't been paying utilities
or maintenance, so...

201
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,763
I'll be working from my
home office for a while.

202
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:33,083
Am I supposed to say something?

203
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,668
It's a nice rug.

204
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,099
Thank you.

205
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,541
How are you feeling
about your birthday today?

206
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,811
Shit.

207
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,379
She's right.

208
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,181
Totally forgot.

209
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,351
It is my birthday today.

210
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,354
Do you have plans tonight?

211
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,791
Uh... no.

212
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,055
In our last session,

213
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:12,869
we talked about your sister.

214
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,871
We haven't been talking.

215
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,641
Can I ask why?

216
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:22,145
She's one of the reasons he comes out.

217
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,014
Talk about that.

218
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,350
Well, he's... been gone, right?

219
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:30,687
He hasn't come out since
I stopped talking to her.

220
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,657
How does that make you feel,

221
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,060
that he's not around anymore?

222
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:40,764
It's different.

223
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,242
It's better. For everyone.

224
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,469
You're still not answering the question.

225
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,141
How do you feel?

226
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,366
Good.

227
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,215
You miss him, don't you?

228
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,153
It's okay if you do.

229
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,358
I miss being a part of something.

230
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,528
Being a part of what, exactly?

231
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,833
Something important.

232
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:19,002
That meant something.

233
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:38,288
Where'd you go?

234
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:47,669
I remembered this time Darlene and I...

235
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,934
Never mind.

236
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,769
I'd love to hear it,

237
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,605
if you don't mind sharing it.

238
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,615
When we were kids,

239
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:09,019
this one year, there
was this huge snowstorm.

240
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,621
And Darlene and I were so excited.

241
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:15,759
And we spent all day
just playing outside.

242
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,362
We made this snowman,
and we called him...

243
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,133
Kevin McAllister,

244
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,336
you know, the kid from "Home Alone."

245
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,672
We were pretty obsessed with that movie.

246
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,608
We even did the hands to the face,

247
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,777
like how he does in the movie.

248
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,445
And how'd that turn out?

249
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,616
He just looked like a snowman

250
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,320
with no arms and weird cheeks.

251
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,193
And we were so proud of it, we promised

252
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:53,129
we'd steal my dad's camera and

253
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,832
take a picture of it before it melted.

254
00:13:55,834 --> 00:14:00,203
And what happened
when you went back out?

255
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,405
I never got a chance to.

256
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,340
Why not?

257
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,576
That was the day of my accident,

258
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,812
when my dad pushed me out the window.

259
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,082
We were at the hospital
till pretty late.

260
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,456
Your dad pushed you out a window?

261
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,958
Yeah.

262
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,626
I've told you that before.

263
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:26,129
Elliot, you've never...

264
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,443
No, you've never told me this.

265
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,666
That's weird.

266
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,701
I remember...

267
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,474
I could have sworn I told you.

268
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,045
There's not much to it.

269
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,047
He pushed me out the window.

270
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,816
I broke my arm and went to the hospital.

271
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,551
Kevin melted.

272
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:51,888
Darlene was pissed.

273
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,090
End of story.

274
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,863
What made you think of this just now?

275
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,087
I don't know.

276
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,910
Truth bombs are coming
your way, Cody-ites.

277
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:34,662
Tonight, please welcome
our special guest,

278
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:37,098
Joanna Wellick. Thanks for being here.

279
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,480
Thank you for having me.

280
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,769
Scott Knowles has,
uh, been facing charges

281
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,238
for murdering his wife, Sharon Knowles.

282
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,407
Initially, your husband, Tyrell Wellick,

283
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,242
was accused of the murder,

284
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,877
until you claimed Scott Knowles

285
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,013
confessed to killing his
wife while beating you.

286
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,583
And since then, a bartender
from the night of the party

287
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:57,552
has also come forward to
corroborate your story.

288
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,254
I know that this must
be difficult for you.

289
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,334
You've been brave just coming here.

290
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,596
Do you want to tell us a
little more about what happened?

291
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,161
My lawyers have advised
me not to speak to that.

292
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:10,065
But what I can say, Frank, is that

293
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:13,435
I didn't need Scott Knowles
to be arrested to know

294
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,537
that my husband is innocent.

295
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,039
Mr. Knowles is...

296
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,342
clearly a troubled man

297
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:24,779
and has been fixating
on us for some time.

298
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:27,182
I understand that you and your son

299
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:30,685
have been tormented endlessly
by fanatics and paparazzi.

300
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:33,755
Some even went so far as to
claim you filed for divorce.

301
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:37,926
I did file for divorce...
a few months ago.

302
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,395
It was a moment of weakness.

303
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:43,098
I listened to the wrong people,

304
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,335
who were convincing me that
that was the right thing to do.

305
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,605
But I have and

306
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,061
always will be faithful

307
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:55,777
to Tyrell.

308
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,615
I have since dismissed
my petition for divorce.

309
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:03,952
He is...

310
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,721
the only man I've ever loved

311
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:08,757
and the only man

312
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,852
I ever will love.

313
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,251
In times of chaos and uncertainty,

314
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:16,157
when the world feels off balance,

315
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,066
we look to those who've stood
with us from the beginning.

316
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,720
Since 1884, we've had America's back.

317
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:25,640
We may get knocked down, but
we'll never be knocked out.

318
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:28,410
Still on your side.

319
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:31,029
Breaking news: a new fsociety video

320
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,814
has been released.

321
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,316
Hello, E Corp.

322
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:36,484
We are fsociety.

323
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,353
We are here to tell you that

324
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:41,523
though you survived our first blow,

325
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:44,407
you will not survive our last.

326
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,329
In the coming weeks,
we will be sending you

327
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,130
a message so loud

328
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:52,056
that it will make your
eardrums explode...

329
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,058
literally.

330
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:56,838
The clock is ticking.

331
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,240
We are fsociety.

332
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,776
We are malicious and hostile.

333
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,967
We do not compromise.

334
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,081
You have been warned.

335
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,356
It was released about an hour ago.

336
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,958
Six weeks, you've given us nothing.

337
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,694
And now we have this to deal with?

338
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,396
That video is bullshit.

339
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,698
That video came from
the same Vimeo account

340
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,035
as the last one you guys used.

341
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:29,971
Then it has to be Dark Army.

342
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:33,675
Cisco probably gave them access.

343
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,110
But that is not one of our guys,

344
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:36,211
okay, trust me on this...

345
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,079
You're a CHS.

346
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:40,181
You understand what that means, right?

347
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:42,484
I don't understand half the
letters you guys throw at me.

348
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:45,253
Confidential human source.

349
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,489
Cool. Now I get it.

350
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,891
See what speaking
English can accomplish?

351
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:53,528
Your job is to get intel
from Elliot on Tyrell Wellick.

352
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,097
That is the only reason
you're not in jail right now.

353
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,050
I don't know what you
want me to tell you, dude.

354
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,968
He's not talking to Tyrell.

355
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,037
How do you know that?

356
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:10,512
Five weeks ago, the
night we lost your tail...

357
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,814
And then gave us a
bullshit explanation as to

358
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,916
where you went? Yeah.

359
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,963
Stink on that still hasn't washed off.

360
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,822
I asked Elliot
point-blank, and he said no.

361
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:24,359
If you don't believe me,

362
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,194
bring him in. He'll
tell you the same thing.

363
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,929
You know that telling
Elliot anything about this

364
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,398
would violate the
terms of your immunity.

365
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,434
It would spook his connection to Tyrell.

366
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,869
Get woke already, dude.

367
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:37,612
He is not nor has he ever

368
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:40,341
had a fucking relationship with Tyrell.

369
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,639
June 16, 2015.

370
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,609
This is a call from Queensboro
Correctional Facility.

371
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,347
Hello?

372
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,716
Is it really you?

373
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:25,497
Who is this?

374
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,593
Bonsoir, Elliot.

375
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,097
You're listening to '80s XM radio.

376
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,010
You've been looking in the
mirror the whole drive home.

377
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,579
I need to make a stop.

378
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:07,095
Stay here.

379
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:26,047
You want to consider
your actions carefully.

380
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,884
She fucking lied to me.

381
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:32,554
She went on national television

382
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:35,557
and she said she still loves him.

383
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:39,427
You love me!

384
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,429
I know you do!

385
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:44,666
You told me we were gonna be together.

386
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:48,303
That's the only reason
I agreed to testify!

387
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,406
You made me lie to the
police to get Tyrell off!

388
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,274
But now I'm gonna tell them the truth!

389
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:59,647
Get up.

390
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:05,753
If you retract your
statement, you will die.

391
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:08,690
I'm not being overly
emotional about this.

392
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,926
It's just that's how little
we care about your life.

393
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,762
Forget this night
ever happened, move on.

394
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,998
Marry a nice, young lady

395
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,067
who actually finds
whatever you are charming.

396
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,002
But understand one thing:

397
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:24,105
as certain as the pain
you're feeling right now,

398
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:26,941
there is no option
where you and Joanna ever

399
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:28,676
see each other again.

400
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:51,666
Is everything under control?

401
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:53,902
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,204
He just needed a little clarity.

403
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:11,185
No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:28,166
The shooter didn't survive.

405
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,035
The driver looks like
he's gonna pull through.

406
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,104
We have someone down at the hospital,

407
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,904
ready to question,
but he's still in ICU.

408
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,473
This information is too sensitive

409
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:35,874
to share with the public.

410
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,309
We got lucky we were on the scene

411
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,578
before anyone saw the body.

412
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,912
What about the baby?

413
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,334
Once you contact the next of kin...

414
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,815
We're not contacting them.

415
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,719
He's going to social services.

416
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:51,323
Don't be soft. Not now.

417
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,259
Her husband is the most
wanted man in the world.

418
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,061
And you and I both
know that finding him is

419
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,829
more important than
anything else, especially

420
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,398
with that goddamn video
that just got released.

421
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:06,004
Something about that video.

422
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,673
I believe Darlene when
she says it's not real.

423
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,543
We have to assume fsociety's
grown past her at this point.

424
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:14,479
Yeah, but why wouldn't
she just say that then?

425
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,982
Her whole immunity's
based on giving us intel.

426
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,484
Right now all she wants to
do is protect her brother,

427
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:22,034
who took a job at E
Corp for Lord knows why.

428
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,870
There's no incentive
for her to lie to us.

429
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:26,240
She didn't even know he
was working with Tyrell.

430
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:27,993
Why would you trust her on this?

431
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:33,064
Because I still think there's
a Dark Army connection here.

432
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,234
We have our other
team looking into them.

433
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,337
Your focus needs to stay
on Tyrell and fsociety.

434
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,811
Guys back at CART are zeroing
in on the guy in the video.

435
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,915
We might have a good lead soon.

436
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,551
Let's just hope you're
reading your girl right.

437
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm worried she's a flight risk.

438
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,791
No, she's good.

439
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,593
Trust me.

440
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,210
I'm surprised you came.

441
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:20,879
Thought you were going the distance

442
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,280
with the silent treatment.

443
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,949
If I remember correctly,

444
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:27,953
you were the one who
told me to go fuck myself.

445
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:31,301
Since when did you start
remembering everything so well?

446
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:40,966
Why'd you text me, Darlene?
What am I doing here?

447
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,457
Wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

448
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,939
Is that all?

449
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,609
God, what is your problem?

450
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,511
Why are you trying to shut me out?

451
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:56,381
- Because we can't talk.
- Why not?

452
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,617
You know why.

453
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,152
Maybe I want to hear you say it.

454
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:03,989
Because...

455
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,591
you're my trigger.

456
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:08,954
What am I, in a fucking therapy session?

457
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,462
Makes sense.

458
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,365
You're my sister, part of my childhood.

459
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,801
If I could take back what
happened to Dad, I would.

460
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,171
What happened to him fucked me up too.

461
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,706
So don't think for a second

462
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,476
our shitty childhood is only yours.

463
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:34,152
I wish Dad were here right now.

464
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,155
He'd know what to do.

465
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,695
I'm leaving.

466
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:45,096
First thing in the morning,

467
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,666
I'm gonna crash with a friend upstate.

468
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:51,169
I can't do this anymore.

469
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,934
I can't be here.

470
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,583
Just thought you'd want to know that.

471
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:04,616
Spending this last year
with you was never about

472
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:07,619
whatever the fuck you
want to call what we did.

473
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,855
The real reason I did all of this

474
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:14,059
was so that we could be close again.

475
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:16,161
I guess that's...

476
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,764
something else I thought
you'd want to know.

477
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,526
You remember when we
made Kevin McAllister,

478
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,844
the snowman?

479
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,498
Of course.

480
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:45,523
Do you... do you want to talk about it?

481
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,386
I want you to stay with me tonight.

482
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,604
I'm good, dude, you don't
have to worry about me.

483
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:00,872
It's not that.

484
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:09,414
I don't want to be alone.

485
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,227
Given the ripple effect
of rapid global inflation,

486
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:26,297
19 of the 20 members of
this international forum

487
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,601
have signed the
Five/Nine Economic Accord,

488
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,403
making Ecoin the currency

489
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,606
by which all others will be measured.

490
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,341
The only obstacle

491
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,677
is the illegitimate monetary imposter

492
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,681
that China has unofficially adopted...

493
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,151
Bitcoin.

494
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,955
China is weakening our economic state

495
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,657
by not signing this accord,

496
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,922
and the fact that they
have embraced Bitcoin

497
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:58,129
shows their resistance

498
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,198
and emphatic rejection

499
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
of our collective attempt

500
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:05,170
to rescue the global economy.

501
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,138
In short,

502
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,307
ladies and gentlemen...

503
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:15,313
They are declaring a currency war.

504
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,925
This has to be brief.

505
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,594
Truthfully, the only
reason I even agreed to meet

506
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:31,529
was that this room happens
to be on my way out...

507
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:34,799
Have your government
sign the goddamn accord!

508
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,371
In 11 days, you'll have what you want.

509
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,141
U.N. vote to annex the
Congo, it's as good as yours,

510
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:46,544
but this currency war must end.

511
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,819
The rest of the world needs
China to embrace Ecoin now.

512
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:58,656
We're at risk of other
countries pulling out.

513
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:05,597
Let me put this as simply as I can,

514
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,534
so that we never have to
belabor this point again.

515
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:14,539
Your success will always follow mine.

516
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,877
I don't give a fuck about your accord.

517
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,379
Until I get my U.N. vote,

518
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,048
don't waste my time.

519
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,017
Or maybe in 11 days,

520
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,604
the administration changes its mind

521
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:31,623
about your precious U.N. vote

522
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:37,061
I worked so hard to procure for you.

523
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,379
Your empty threat reminds me

524
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:57,949
that there's something
I never shared with you.

525
00:31:57,951 --> 00:32:00,718
My associates found your pet employee

526
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
after she smuggled out documents on

527
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,722
the Washington Township plant.

528
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:08,159
Now that I've gotten a
chance to talk to her,

529
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,295
I can see why you like her.

530
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:14,465
She makes a very good companion.

531
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,267
And those eyes of hers...

532
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,003
I contemplated firing a
bullet into each of them,

533
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:24,142
but they're just so hypnotizing.

534
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:32,550
Don't mistake my generosity

535
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:36,054
for generosity.

536
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,342
What are you doing?

537
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,678
Why are you awake? It's early.

538
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,881
You're not answering my question.

539
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,750
What were you doing by my computer?

540
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:44,687
I saw you behind the monitor.

541
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,590
Jesus, I was looking for a pen.

542
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,924
To write you a note.

543
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,526
What's with the fucking paranoia?

544
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,294
A note for what?

545
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,396
I'm leaving. I have to catch my bus.

546
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,101
The buses aren't running.

547
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:59,768
There's a transportation
strike, it's all over the news.

548
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,303
Okay, the train then.

549
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,606
What's with the interrogation?

550
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,108
You were gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

551
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,974
Thus, the note.

552
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:10,513
And here I thought we were
in a good fucking place

553
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,947
after last night.

554
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,218
You're not answering
my fucking question.

555
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,753
Why are you here?

556
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,390
What do you mean? You invited me.

557
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,925
Jesus.

558
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,260
It's you.

559
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,895
What'd you do with the computer?

560
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,463
Why did you sleep here last night?

561
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,388
- You're scaring me...
- Answer me!

562
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,267
- Are you serious, Elliot?
- Answer me!

563
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,735
- You're hurting me... stop!
- Answer me!

564
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,270
- Why...
- Stop!

565
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,475
Stay the fuck away from me,

566
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,844
you fucking psycho.

567
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,843
So how does it work?

568
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,812
How does what work?

569
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,982
If I wanted you to talk to him.

570
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,018
What happened? Did he come back?

571
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,354
I need you to talk to him.

572
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,157
Didn't you say that that could help?

573
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,027
Everyone's case is different.

574
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,896
But yes,

575
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,935
I think this can help you.

576
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,070
What do we do?

577
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,906
Let's just take a moment.

578
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,876
Why don't you sit back and relax?

579
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,384
I'd like you to close your eyes.

580
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:01,523
Take a deep breath.

581
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,794
Listen to the sound of my voice.

582
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:11,460
If you want me to talk to him,

583
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,969
just let him come to me.

584
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,835
Give him permission.

585
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,768
Elliot?

586
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:51,343
You should know that
nothing's gonna come from this.

587
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:54,012
We were doing just fine.

588
00:36:57,117 --> 00:36:59,551
It's nice to finally meet you.

589
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:08,226
This was better when I
could just come and go

590
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,961
as I pleased,

591
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,997
when we were whole.

592
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:15,167
Now I'm seeing things that
he should be seeing too.

593
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,671
We're just getting torn apart.

594
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,275
You need to leave us alone so
I can get him back to our work.

595
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,381
Elliot never told me
how attractive you are.

596
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:32,350
You know, for a shrink,
you're, uh, pretty foxy.

597
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,019
Thank you, but...

598
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,388
I'm more interested
in talking about you.

599
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,144
Come on. Never thought about it?

600
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:39,886
Getting with one of your patients?

601
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,661
That would cross some
ethical boundaries for me.

602
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:45,097
Sucks for you.

603
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,767
Everybody knows crazy can be sexy.

604
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,535
So you think you're crazy?

605
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:51,903
Relax.

606
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:55,199
It's a figure of speech.

607
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:57,503
Can I ask for your name?

608
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:59,906
Well, what does he call me?

609
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,781
- Mr. Robot.
- Seriously?

610
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,549
He still calls me that?

611
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:06,618
Talk about labels.

612
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:11,523
I'd like to talk about why you're here.

613
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:14,659
"A civilization which leaves
so many of its citizens

614
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:17,696
unsatisfied and drives them into revolt

615
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,397
neither has nor deserves the prospect

616
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,033
of a lasting existence."

617
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,236
Who said that?

618
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:26,938
Freud.

619
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,674
Wow. Beautiful and smart.

620
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,612
Sorry.

621
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,948
As beautiful as you are,

622
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,885
you're not getting inside my head.

623
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,419
Why not?

624
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,421
Because before you found out about me,

625
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,056
we were good.

626
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:46,558
I'm trying to help him.

627
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,126
You're not trying to help him.

628
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,910
You're trying to destroy me.

629
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,080
I'm not trying to destroy you.

630
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,599
Quite the opposite, actually.

631
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,503
I want to understand you.

632
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:59,840
You understand shit.

633
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:04,576
You're just another phony
cooze playing friend.

634
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:06,511
Eh, it doesn't matter anymore anyway.

635
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,880
Because of her, we've been compromised.

636
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:11,783
She compromised us, and
Elliot didn't see it.

637
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,718
What do you mean,
you've been compromised?

638
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:39,744
I'm done talking to you.

639
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:53,261
Krista?

640
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:57,808
When are we gonna start?

641
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:04,002
What happened? Were you there?

642
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,735
Did you go with me or stay with him?

643
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:06,769
What did you see?

644
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,417
What did Mr. Robot mean,
"We've been compromised"?

645
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,589
You were there, you heard
it along with her, right?

646
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,592
What was Mr. Robot talking about?

647
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:16,944
Scan my QR code and I'll suck your dick.

648
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,366
Who compromised us? Who's even us?

649
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,308
Him and me? Or him and Tyrell?

650
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:24,386
No, he couldn't still
be working with Tyrell.

651
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,758
Could he?

652
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,727
Is Stage 2 still on?

653
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,996
No, I would know. That's impossible.

654
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:33,298
Stage 2 is down. I made sure of it.

655
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,865
Who compromised me?

656
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:37,435
And why do I suddenly feel so alive?

657
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,057
How do you do it?

658
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,826
How do you get so lucky?

659
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,966
Even when the world's going to shit,

660
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,474
you're sitting pretty.

661
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:14,083
The truth is,

662
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:17,108
I never gave a shit about the dog.

663
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,752
In fact, I hate the dog.

664
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:22,421
Vet bills are through the roof

665
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:25,717
because this little
piece of shit is sick.

666
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,787
She's been shitting all
over my house for weeks.

667
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,423
It's probably dying.

668
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:34,392
Figured you wanted her so badly,

669
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:36,928
let her shit all over your house.

670
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,558
Like you did mine.

671
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:15,143
Good job.

672
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:39,964
Stage 2.

673
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,457
I want it to happen on
the day of the U.N. vote.

674
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,317
Whether it goes our way or not.

675
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:55,234
Sir, Stage 2 is only
meant to be implemented

676
00:43:55,237 --> 00:43:57,837
if Price doesn't come through.

677
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,676
If the U.N. approves our
annexation of the Congo,

678
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,424
we can finally move our operation

679
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:06,394
to the country's Luwow mine.

680
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:11,099
Why would you still
want to carry this out,

681
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:14,691
given the serious implications?

682
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:22,456
It's time Phillip
Price's hand got slapped.

683
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:05,565
Last time I buy from that coffee shop.

684
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:06,901
They only take Ecoin.

685
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,460
Gotta use Ecoin.

686
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,596
With the exchange rate,
dollar's worth shit now.

687
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:18,099
You get anything from Elliot's computer?

688
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:19,718
He hasn't logged in all day.

689
00:45:19,721 --> 00:45:22,970
Last night he sent an
encrypted email with a link.

690
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:26,307
Could be lucky,

691
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,195
could be sending it to Tyrell, right?

692
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:29,764
Is this from last night?

693
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:33,848
Oh, also I was able to get

694
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,184
a clean audio recording of his place.

695
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:37,531
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

696
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,900
He dropped some good intel.

697
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,456
Here, let me play it for you.

698
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:45,945
Ugh.

699
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:47,981
That'll be stuck in my head all day now.

700
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,635
Turn it off.

701
00:45:54,637 --> 00:45:56,518
Is that coming from downstairs?

702
00:45:58,009 --> 00:45:59,854
Yeah, that's Darlene's apartment, but...

703
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,256
who the fuck is that?

704
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,159
- Is Darlene home?
- No, she's out.

705
00:46:04,669 --> 00:46:07,115
You think she told someone
about the safe house?

706
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:13,187
This email he sent from his computer,

707
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:14,789
did you go to this link?

708
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,288
Yeah, downloaded the file, opened it,

709
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,627
but didn't find anything.

710
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,331
This email isn't for Tyrell.

711
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:30,771
It's for us.
