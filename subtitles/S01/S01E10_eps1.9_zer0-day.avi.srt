1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,832
Come on! Will you... will
you go? Come on, go, go.

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:07,142
Hey, you cheated on your current wife

3
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,147
with seven different women.

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,651
I got digital proof of all of it.

5
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:10,943
And if you don't stop seeing Krista,

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,505
your wife will know everything.

7
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,458
- Done.
- And one more thing.

8
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,893
I'm gonna need something from you.

9
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:19,896
I don't just hack you,
Krista, I hack everyone.

10
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:23,099
So I gotta be honest,
I was impressed by you.

11
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:28,404
I think I can land you
a pretty lucrative gig.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,505
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

13
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,945
Elliot, listen to me.
I will never leave you.

14
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:37,530
I will never leave you alone again.

15
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:42,742
- Who are you talking to?
- Since last month,

16
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,829
- Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five...
- Five backup facilities

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,252
and you have a plan to take them all down.

18
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,416
Why are you working with us?

19
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:55,782
The hack, everything, maybe
we shouldn't execute it.

20
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:56,966
Why?

21
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,435
The minute our infected server
gets back on the main network,

22
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,637
we're set.

23
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,805
Scott will continue here,

24
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:05,275
but you, I'm afraid, cannot.

25
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,680
_

26
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:09,874
_

27
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,281
- What the hell are you...
- Shh.

28
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,922
I don't know what your grand plan is,

29
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,747
but I need to, and you're going to tell me.

30
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,643
Why did you do it?

31
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,793
What did you hope to
accomplish by doing all of this?

32
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:26,996
I wanted to save the world.

33
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:46,566
Hey.

34
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,685
It's so good to see you.

35
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,471
You look great.

36
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:01,831
- Can I get you a drink?
- Look, Michael, I don't...

37
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,003
Jesus.

38
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,122
I forgot.

39
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:11,507
It's not even your real name.

40
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,713
It's, uh... Lenny.

41
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:22,301
Lenny.

42
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:25,054
So tell me what's going on.

43
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:28,224
How advanced is it?

44
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:31,060
I already emailed my
friend at Sloan Kettering.

45
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,528
If it's as serious as you say...

46
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:34,981
- Krista. Krista.
- Then she wants to...

47
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,232
Look.

48
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:41,704
I'm not dying.

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,126
You're a sick motherfucker!

50
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:48,202
Look, hold on. It's the only way

51
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,960
- I could get you to meet up.
- Don't you ever call me again,

52
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,102
- even when you are dying.
- One of your patients hacked me.

53
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,501
Some kid.

54
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:58,421
His name's Elliot Alderson.

55
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,174
I went to the police already.

56
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:04,260
Please sit back down.

57
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,145
We need to talk about this.

58
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,193
Here. The police had
their cyber crime division

59
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:21,778
look into it.

60
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,115
They've been trying to track
him down for the past six weeks.

61
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:28,035
- What is this?
- That proves it was him.

62
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:30,286
He took my dog to the vet.

63
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:33,289
Look. See, she was microchipped,

64
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,843
and I gave her chip number
to all the vets in the city.

65
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:43,349
This sick fucker not only
hacked me and ruined my life,

66
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,134
he stole my dog on top of it.

67
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:48,967
This guy's certifiable.

68
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:52,191
I mean, he's seeing you,
so technically he is.

69
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,043
- What did he do to you exactly?
- He made me...

70
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:03,569
you know...

71
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,822
say all those things to you.

72
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:13,129
This kid should not be
allowed to do what he did.

73
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:16,332
He hacked into my private life.

74
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:19,085
And then that Ashley
Madison leak happened.

75
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:22,505
My wife found out about
everything anyway.

76
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:25,141
After the whole thing, she left me.

77
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:27,477
I can't even see my little girl.

78
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:31,363
- The divorce is... is a nightmare.
- I don't give a shit about your divorce.

79
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:33,015
Look, if he's doing this to me,

80
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:36,185
then he must be doing this to other people.

81
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,687
Think about it.

82
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,656
If he knew enough
about me to hack me,

83
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,910
then that means he must
have hacked you, too.

84
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:48,865
He did, didn't he?

85
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:03,504
- I can't talk about this with you.
- Hey! You have to help me catch him.

86
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,849
The dog thing alone isn't enough.

87
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:10,136
My buddy says this
Computer Abuse and Fraud Act

88
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:11,721
is tough to prosecute.

89
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,190
You need a lot of evidence.

90
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,309
This kid is good, Krista.

91
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,862
He was routing through something
called proxies or something

92
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:20,897
out in Estonia.

93
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,231
He's untraceable.

94
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,400
Short of that whole
country falling apart,

95
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:27,153
we're never gonna get our
hands on any real evidence.

96
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:33,680
- Just what exactly do you think I can do?
- Maybe he said something.

97
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,413
You know, in your sessions.

98
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,499
Oh, come on, don't give me that
privileged information bullshit.

99
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:42,835
This guy's committing
a crime, a serious one.

100
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,254
He deserves to go to jail.

101
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,974
If you know something,

102
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,593
if he said anything,
you have to tell me.

103
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:55,932
Look, I'm not the enemy here.

104
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:59,101
He is.

105
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,687
We were a good thing.

106
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:03,606
Remember?

107
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:06,943
I mean, don't you remember this place?

108
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:11,948
We had some good times here.

109
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,116
Come on.

110
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,089
Don't stay mad at me.

111
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:21,958
I really loved you.

112
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:29,465
He never told me anything.

113
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,934
I can't help you.

114
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,479
The asshole stole my dog!

115
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,803
The response to the Japanese
and Chinese stock markets

116
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,339
has provoked panic, setting
off the downward trends

117
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,341
of the European stock exchange.

118
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:14,010
But what's even more worrisome

119
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:17,346
is that the IMF has no leverage
against these defaults.

120
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,565
Already, 17 governments
are said to be

121
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,985
in large-scale crises with
some on the verge of collapse.

122
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,021
Among the countries are Lithuania,

123
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,523
Croatia, Ukraine, Romania,

124
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,192
the Czech Republic, and Estonia.

125
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:32,194
This faction has deemed
the hack inflicted

126
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,030
upon the world's largest conglomerate

127
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:37,533
as an opportunity for reform
and a chance to start anew,

128
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,202
building more egalitarian
economies with lessons learned

129
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,089
from decades of economic disparity.

130
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,840
A spokesperson for a group...

131
00:07:53,551 --> 00:08:00,133
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

132
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,527
- Where am I?
- Excuse me?

133
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,468
- I mean, where am I?
- You've been parked

134
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,427
in the lot for the past two days.

135
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,895
That's as much as you paid me

136
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,597
before the credit card systems went down.

137
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:42,732
I'm gonna need some cash, man.

138
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:51,073
This is Tyrell's.

139
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,278
Why were we in there?

140
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,030
Oh, don't tell me you don't have any cash.

141
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,583
Ha, you're shit out of
luck for a while, buddy.

142
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:04,420
I don't understand.

143
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:08,924
How long have you been asleep?

144
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,044
Seriously, what do you remember?

145
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:14,764
Wait, I don't even trust you.

146
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,469
Hey.

147
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,221
Hey, where you going?

148
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,107
What about your car?

149
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:29,145
Hey, we're gonna tow your car tonight!

150
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:00,370
- What took you so long?
- I just had to shower and change.

151
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:04,146
You're still new here. I wouldn't push it.

152
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,453
Jesus Christ, finally you're here.

153
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,337
- Where have you been?
- Yeah, man.

154
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,674
I mean, not cool, not cool at all.

155
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,375
I thought we were
gonna execute together.

156
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,044
I mean, what is going on here?

157
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:37,179
He's just saying that we
had planned on something

158
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,684
- a little more ceremonial.
- Ceremonial? Man,

159
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:40,799
we been wiping drives,

160
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,302
wrangling cables, pulling
fiber taps and the...

161
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:44,553
Okay, everyone, lay off!

162
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,522
I'm sure he had his reasons.

163
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:48,891
Besides, whatever. The
point is, it worked.

164
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,227
- Jesus, what did I do?
- We need to clean up

165
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:52,645
and get the hell out of here.

166
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,396
Were you there? Did you see it?

167
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,213
- What did I do?
- Elliot, what's going on?

168
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,203
You disappear on me at the apartment

169
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,570
and come here to execute
without even telling me.

170
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,490
Execute. It executed, but how?

171
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,588
- I... what happened to Tyrell?
- Then you were gone

172
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,994
for another three days.

173
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:14,815
- Where have you been?
- Are you saying... it went through?

174
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,219
Like gangbusters.

175
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:18,837
People are loving it.

176
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,340
They actually want to join fsociety.

177
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:25,010
Elliot, they're organizing
protests all across the city.

178
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,771
_

179
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,414
_

180
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,056
_

181
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:49,289
_

182
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,835
_

183
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,240
_

184
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:59,262
_

185
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:02,131
Elliot! What's going on?

186
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:11,234
- Are you still seeing him?
- No, but I need to.

187
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,643
Dude, you can't just leave.

188
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:15,634
We're in wipe-down mode here

189
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:20,232
- and we need your help.
- I told you we shouldn't have done this.

190
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,410
So, okay, your burn rate,

191
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,159
that's rent and utilities
alone, is 50,000 a month.

192
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,181
Your lease isn't up for
another three months,

193
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,716
so we have to eat those
costs no matter what.

194
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:38,554
So that leaves us with
staffing, operations,

195
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:41,940
outstanding loans, equipment rentals.

196
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,559
I'm just gonna call it, Gideon.

197
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:47,396
You have to shut down Allsafe.

198
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,733
Maybe I can just buy some time.

199
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,569
We could bounce back from this.

200
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,404
Gideon, your number one client

201
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,406
is in the middle of a major crisis.

202
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,042
You can't escape the
fallout from this.

203
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,211
As your part-time CFO and your friend,

204
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,580
I have to be honest and tell you,

205
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,381
this is beyond bleak.

206
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:12,161
- When is it not?
- I'm sorry?

207
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,924
Ever since I started this company,

208
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:18,594
it's felt like we've just been

209
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:23,015
rearranging chairs on
the goddamn "Titanic."

210
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,817
When was the last time you and I

211
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:28,814
- have not had a depressing conversation?
- Gideon, I handle the money.

212
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,939
It's always gonna be a
depressing conversation.

213
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,916
Best thing you can do for them

214
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,335
is to let them know soon
so they can find other jobs.

215
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,289
And...

216
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,770
What?

217
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,571
All their 401(k)s were

218
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:54,138
tied up in the market...

219
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,633
Which is expected to
plummet once the bell rings.

220
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,436
Well, that's only rumors at this point.

221
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,771
What?

222
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,524
Seems to be a little more than rumors.

223
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,476
Every bank is essentially affected.

224
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:09,945
I know I couldn't use any of my
credit cards over the weekend.

225
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,447
Could you?

226
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,866
Well, I don't know.

227
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,984
There might be a silver lining to all this.

228
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,487
If what they're saying
about these fsociety hackers

229
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:22,658
is actually true, you'll now have no debt.

230
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:38,497
Why did Tyrell let this happen?

231
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,680
He was with me. I told
him the whole plan.

232
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,016
He was gonna stop it.

233
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:52,404
A simple program, a worm that
can make data unreadable,

234
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:55,908
malware that took Darlene
maybe two hours to code.

235
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:59,528
Is that really all it
takes to kill the world?

236
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,749
Shouldn't I be enjoying this?

237
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,375
- _
- Why am I even looking for Tyrell?

238
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,168
Isn't this what we wanted?

239
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,540
So this is what a
revolution looks like,

240
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,092
people in expensive
clothing running around.

241
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,711
Not how I pictured it.

242
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,047
I wonder what stage they're at.

243
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:21,516
Denial? Muttering to themselves?

244
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,602
No, this can be fixed.

245
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:27,022
Maybe bargaining, forcing
their techs to work overtime

246
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,690
to try to decrypt our data.

247
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:32,027
Or have they come to
the realization yet

248
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,862
that Darlene encrypted everything

249
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,982
with 256-bit AES and it would take

250
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,535
an incomprehensible
amount of time to crack?

251
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:45,374
That all of their data is
actually gone for good?

252
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
No, I have to find him.

253
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:58,920
I have to know what happened.

254
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,727
_

255
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:13,277
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes, I'm looking for Tyrell Wellick.

256
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,238
He's not here.

257
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,273
He doesn't work here anymore.

258
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,741
Why are you here? What do
you need to see him for?

259
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,576
And, yes, confirmation coming in.

260
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,779
This is fsociety
claiming responsibility

261
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,447
for the hack.

262
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,416
We are cutting live to
the video right now.

263
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:33,005
Evil Corp, we have delivered
on our promise as expected.

264
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,592
The people of the world who
have been enslaved by you

265
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,544
have been freed.

266
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:42,431
Your financial data
has been destroyed.

267
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,850
Any attempts to salvage it

268
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,602
will be utterly futile.

269
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:51,390
Face it, you have been owned.

270
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:54,443
We at fsociety will smile

271
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:59,448
as we watch you and
your dark soul die.

272
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,284
That means any money
you owe these pigs

273
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,870
has been forgiven by us,

274
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:08,457
your friends at fsociety.

275
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,959
The market's opening
bell this morning

276
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:14,212
will be the final death
knell of Evil Corp.

277
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:17,999
We hope, as a new society
rises from the ashes,

278
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,502
that you will forge a better world,

279
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,171
a world that values a free people,

280
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:26,391
a world where greed
is not encouraged,

281
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:30,145
a world that belongs to us again,

282
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,349
a world changed forever!

283
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:38,987
And while you do that,
remember to repeat these words.

284
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,857
We are fsociety.

285
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:45,401
- We are finally free.
- _

286
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:49,364
We are finally awake!

287
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,038
Authorities have been trying
to locate the whereabouts

288
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,874
of the mysterious masked man

289
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,877
as well as other members
of the fsociety collective.

290
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,129
The investigation is still underway.

291
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:07,421
The FBI Cybercrime
Division is working with...

292
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,807
Where's my bag?

293
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,977
I need my bag. It... it has all my papers.

294
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,363
I put all of your talking
points on these index cards

295
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:21,774
- so that you wouldn't have to...
- God damn it!

296
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,901
Will you please just give
me my bag, for Christ's sake?

297
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,819
I asked you to keep it close by.

298
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,154
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,123
I didn't mean anything by it.

300
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:32,334
- I was just trying to...
- Never mind what you meant.

301
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,709
Just do as I say.

302
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,801
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,220
I didn't mean to snap at you.

304
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,172
It's been a long day,

305
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:49,892
and... and I'm not used to
all the new faces around here.

306
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,513
No problem.

307
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,515
Four minutes, people!

308
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,850
Let's get last looks. Let's go.

309
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:01,988
So anyways, this should
fry anything and everything

310
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,189
to a crisp.

311
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,524
You're in luck. My boss is at the bank.

312
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,192
Seems like everybody's
lining up this morning.

313
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,411
So you got some time.

314
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,743
Jesus,

315
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:13,249
- are we really doing this right now?
- Hey, I don't need no judgment.

316
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,917
Not like I want to be here either.

317
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,670
Sorry, dude, I got no sympathy.

318
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:20,506
You don't want to put cute
puppies out of their misery,

319
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,425
you don't have to.

320
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,709
That's just sick.

321
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,261
That ain't on me. I gotta pay the bills.

322
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,547
That's the only reason why I'm here.

323
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:54,624
You know, I've run all the scenarios

324
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:59,128
of our little revolution here, but, uh...

325
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,748
using a dead puppy oven was not on my list.

326
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:23,496
Can I help you?

327
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,839
Yeah.

328
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,676
Looking for Tyrell Wellick.

329
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,612
- Is he here?
- No.

330
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,933
He's not.

331
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,187
Do you know where he is?

332
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,207
- Who are you?
- Good question.

333
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:57,947
We work together.

334
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,502
He'll be home soon.

335
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,755
Just called me from
the car ten minutes ago.

336
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,040
He's stuck in some traffic.

337
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,259
You're welcome to wait
inside if you want.

338
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,211
Whoo! Oh, shit!

339
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:14,130
- Come on, get up!
- Fsociety, bitch!

340
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:17,044
- Yeah, that's how it is, baby!
- Whoo!

341
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,222
What did you say your name was?

342
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:28,728
Uh... I'm Ollie.

343
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:33,566
And what were you working
on with my husband?

344
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,735
You've gotta help
me get out of this.

345
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,236
There's something about her.

346
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:38,788
I feel like she can hear us.

347
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,040
He wanted my advice,

348
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:45,578
you know, about the hack
that's going on right now.

349
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,496
When was the last time you saw him?

350
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,718
She's lying to me. He isn't coming.

351
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,588
She's fishing for something.

352
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,474
I'm not sure.

353
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,260
It was last week, I think.

354
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,479
Really?

355
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,770
You know, between you and me,

356
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm a little concerned for Tyrell.

357
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,992
Was he acting strange when you saw him?

358
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,616
No.

359
00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:26,001
That's funny,

360
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,038
'cause he was acting very strange

361
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,841
last I saw him.

362
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,676
Three days ago.

363
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,165
Didn't she say he just called?

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,132
And then he just vanished.

365
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:52,027
Excuse me?

366
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,813
I don't understand what you're saying.

367
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,144
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think it's just the stress

368
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:12,965
from the past few days getting to me.

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,584
Anyway, I shouldn't take
up any more of your time.

370
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:22,057
Thank you... Ollie.

371
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:50,920
And, Sarah, we've had meetings all weekend

372
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:53,038
handling the situation.

373
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,757
I'm being told by our network storage team

374
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,259
that they are in fact
getting to the bottom of this.

375
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,879
Mr. Plouffe, have you seen
the latest stock price?

376
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,181
It's hitting an all-time low of $18,

377
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:03,883
and it's still dropping.

378
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,385
How are people reacting
to this on the inside?

379
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:10,556
Almost $400 billion of
wealth was lost today.

380
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:14,610
That's pretty astounding.
Are you concerned?

381
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,729
That's an interesting question.

382
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,731
But right now we're focused on tackling

383
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,616
the technical issues at hand.

384
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,568
We have loyal customers who are suffering,

385
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,538
and our number one priority
is to address their needs.

386
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:27,907
We had one of our experts
in here earlier today.

387
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,575
They're saying that if, in fact,

388
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:31,494
fsociety's claims are true...

389
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:33,078
Your data is inaccessible

390
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,748
and could prove nearly
impossible to recover.

391
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,083
And given that there does seem
to be some legitimacy to this...

392
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:41,086
The White House is with us on this.

393
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:42,755
They're gonna protect everyone's money.

394
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,474
The bottom line is

395
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,427
the public does not
need to worry about this.

396
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,896
Mr. Plouffe, this
was a massive attack.

397
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:54,233
All of your servers, including
your data center in China

398
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,902
as well as your offline
backups have been destroyed.

399
00:25:56,938 --> 00:26:00,439
I'm not really sure you can
ask the public not to worry.

400
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,286
- You want me to be honest?
- Of course.

401
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:18,090
You're right. Absolutely right.

402
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,293
The public should be worried.

403
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:25,431
I mean, personally, my life is over.

404
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:27,099
What's happening?

405
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:31,303
My pension, savings, everything...

406
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:33,606
has been in this company
since I started here,

407
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:37,476
and that's all gone now.

408
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:40,145
Truth is...

409
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:42,982
I've been with the
engineering team all weekend.

410
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,117
This has to stop. That's enough.

411
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:46,819
No one knows how to fix it.

412
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:52,157
In fact, about the only
thing we do know for certain

413
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,628
is that...

414
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:59,665
this will be impossible to fix.

415
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,884
You need to take care of this.

416
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:15,848
Calm down, everyone.

417
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,397
That's all we need from
Ms. Moss, Mr. Price.

418
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,132
- Good. Thank you.
- Sir.

419
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,600
Thanks.

420
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,681
I heard you were leaving for the day.

421
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:50,419
Mr. Price...

422
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:55,658
- did you need me to stay?
- No, no, no, no. Sit, sit.

423
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,910
I know I'm the CEO of the company,

424
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,963
but what you went
through, it was traumatic.

425
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:05,217
I just felt I needed to
make myself available.

426
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,837
You are absolutely free to... to go home

427
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,059
and... and recover, of course.

428
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:16,095
All right?

429
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,100
Oh.

430
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:25,354
You're Terry's reference, right?

431
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:30,326
I rarely see him impressed
with anyone, but you... you?

432
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:34,947
Well... we're glad you're on the team.

433
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:39,785
And I look forward to
you impressing me as well.

434
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,371
You know, I'm... I'm
holding a press conference

435
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:44,040
this afternoon.

436
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:45,624
Since you're new to the PR department,

437
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,176
I think you should attend.

438
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:50,212
You might pick up some invaluable lessons.

439
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:56,802
Um...

440
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:59,221
no.

441
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:02,692
No, I'm not sure that I can.

442
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:10,700
Well, the invitation is open

443
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:13,736
if you should change your mind.

444
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,574
Um...

445
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:29,418
You need some new shoes.

446
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,804
Those won't do anymore.

447
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,211
Tyrell Wellick's gone.

448
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:15,840
I wake up in his SUV and the
world's about to fall apart.

449
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,143
I know. I know this looks bad,

450
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:29,258
but I'm sure there's an explanation.

451
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:32,231
Don't think that. We'll find him.

452
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,617
We'll find him. He's
gotta be somewhere.

453
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:37,119
My dad, Mr. Robot,
whatever the hell he is,

454
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,789
if he's not gonna show
up, maybe he got sloppy,

455
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,662
left behind a clue.

456
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,905
_

457
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:21,197
All right, come out!

458
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,865
Come out now!

459
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:29,622
Come on!

460
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:32,541
I need to know what happened!

461
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,627
Come on out!

462
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,629
I'm here!

463
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:39,515
I'm waiting for you!

464
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,684
Come on, man.

465
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:43,219
Come out!

466
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:46,722
Okay, we have to go analog for this.

467
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,891
We need to get these fliers out now

468
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:52,061
since we can't be sure anyone's
Internet access will work.

469
00:31:56,817 --> 00:32:00,319
What? I'm thinking ahead.

470
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:03,072
First banking, then infrastructure.

471
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:05,824
We've been through this.

472
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:09,044
Now, take these fliers, pass them out.

473
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:13,215
It's the last step and then we're clear.

474
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:16,752
You guys are acting like we're
walking towards doomsday here.

475
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:19,471
Well, it does say here

476
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:24,176
it's an end of the world party.

477
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,178
Figure of speech.

478
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:34,186
You wonder why we're
not in high spirits?

479
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,938
Maybe it's because our fearless leader goes

480
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,274
and shoots up the world
and then disappears,

481
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:41,493
yet again, while we're
here cleaning up after him.

482
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,860
_

483
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,567
He knows the password,

484
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,283
which means I know the password.

485
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:33,137
_

486
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,529
What's he trying to say?

487
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:10,616
I'm on the hook for everything?

488
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:20,843
He won't come out to play if I ask.

489
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,879
So maybe I gotta force his hand.

490
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,549
I need to use a landline.

491
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:30,552
I need to get myself arrested.

492
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:39,554
- 911. What's your emergency?
- I have a confession to make.

493
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:43,565
All right, you got me.

494
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:46,235
I'm afraid to ask.

495
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:49,288
Now, wait a minute, you said you work...

496
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,078
Was this from the guy?

497
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,165
The one they're talking about on the news?

498
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:05,137
Um... yes.

499
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:15,147
You mean to tell me you
witnessed this thing...

500
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:17,733
and you're here to buy new shoes?

501
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:25,991
Wow.

502
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:28,944
That's pretty...

503
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:31,663
It's just pretty cold.

504
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:34,249
How can you work there?

505
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,335
That guy said it himself,
they're just liars.

506
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:40,255
I know. They are.

507
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:43,342
But I'm not sure

508
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,461
that he knew what he was saying.

509
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:47,296
Oh, you sound just like them.

510
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:51,350
Have some moral fiber
and leave their asses.

511
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,469
Their practices are well-documented

512
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:55,637
and it's all despicable.

513
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,056
Listen, this isn't my business,

514
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:59,775
but don't drink their Kool-Aid.

515
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:01,977
Look, I just needed a job.

516
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:03,312
What kind of an excuse is that?

517
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,364
- You don't understand.
- You should hear yourself.

518
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,581
I don't know who you
think you're talking to,

519
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,235
but I'll try the Pradas next.

520
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,979
Calm down.

521
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:40,349
Get your caramel latte. It's on me.

522
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,685
- Where is he?
- You know how this looks, right?

523
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,437
Very weird.

524
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,432
I don't give a shit.

525
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:55,998
- Where's Tyrell?
- We made a deal that helped us both.

526
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,700
Tell me where he is!

527
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,252
You're starting to attract some attention.

528
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,621
I recommend you get one of
those Bluetooth headsets.

529
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:04,506
That way people just think
you're the local douche.

530
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:06,758
Tyrell disappeared.

531
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,546
No one knows where he is.

532
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:11,713
But you know.

533
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,936
So do you.

534
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:20,522
You forget, kiddo, I am you.

535
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:27,082
- No, you're not.
- Is that a fact?

536
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:43,879
Hey, man, I gotta tell you I had
sex with your mom this morning,

537
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:45,297
and it was fantastic.

538
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:51,086
Don't have time for you, little man.

539
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:54,256
Your mom was real nice. Smell.

540
00:37:54,258 --> 00:37:56,425
God! What did you do to him?

541
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:58,143
What did I do?

542
00:37:58,145 --> 00:37:59,478
Well, did you just see what he did?

543
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,396
- No, I don't know, man.
- Yeah, he flicked my nose.

544
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,170
You're losing it, kiddo.

545
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,875
I'm only supposed to be your prophet.

546
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:17,021
You're supposed to be my god.

547
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,069
Come on!

548
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,210
The dramatic repercussions of
the recent financial meltdown

549
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:24,412
are not relegated to
developing nations.

550
00:38:24,464 --> 00:38:27,081
The United States has also
witnessed a disruption

551
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:28,833
of order and peace.

552
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,636
While businesses determine how
or whether they will function

553
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:34,088
through the uncertainty,
individuals have taken

554
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,891
to the streets, giving the
major cities a tenor...

555
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:39,260
Ooh.

556
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:41,679
Very nice.

557
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,431
I'm glad you reconsidered.

558
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,271
What? What is it?

559
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:53,024
Come on.

560
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,859
You have questions.

561
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,995
I'm a person with a lot of answers,

562
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,197
especially right now.

563
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,703
Okay.

564
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:09,874
It's just that...

565
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:13,594
well, I can't help but wonder,

566
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,847
why do you seem so confident?

567
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:22,437
Everyone else is worried, but you?

568
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:25,606
You're sure that you're
gonna get through this.

569
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:28,643
- Why?
- Hmm.

570
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,500
- People did this. Right?
- _

571
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,621
I mean, aliens didn't
invade our planet.

572
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:43,041
Zeus didn't come out of
the heavens to destroy us.

573
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:46,133
Zombies haven't risen from the dead.

574
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:48,913
No.

575
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:51,165
Whoever's behind this,

576
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:53,751
they're just people...

577
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:58,172
like you and me.

578
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,091
Except, of course, I have the full weight

579
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:03,594
of the biggest conglomerate
in the world behind me.

580
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:06,981
You'll come to realize
that when you have that,

581
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:12,020
matters like this, they tend to crack...

582
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:14,381
under that weight.

583
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:20,452
Can I ask another question?

584
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:24,115
All right, go.

585
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,451
Why me?

586
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:30,538
Why am I really here?

587
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,590
I know you know who I am.

588
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:35,543
Why are you letting me be here?

589
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:39,881
Why are you even talking to me right now?

590
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,266
None of this makes any sense.

591
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:46,437
Well, be that as it may, I...

592
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:49,440
I find you refreshing.

593
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:52,810
You're young, bold,

594
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:57,031
exactly what we need right now.

595
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,400
- Come on.
- What?

596
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:02,236
There has to be more to it than that.

597
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:05,706
Angela, just a word of advice.

598
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:08,326
Don't talk your way out of a compliment.

599
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:11,796
Excuse me. They'll be ready.

600
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:13,831
Shall we?

601
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:25,143
Oh, you're still thinking
about this morning.

602
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,681
I don't think I'll ever get
that image out of my head.

603
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,155
Between you and me, I was
glad he killed himself.

604
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:40,608
He was not a very good person.

605
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,693
He had a gambling problem.

606
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:44,328
He drank too much.

607
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:47,115
Most notably, he was weak.

608
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,667
His instincts left a lot to be desired.

609
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:53,421
Oh, I despise people like that.

610
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:57,091
In fact, I felt...

611
00:41:57,127 --> 00:42:01,179
the world was a little better off

612
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:05,633
knowing he wasn't in it anymore.

613
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:09,887
Oh, I believe even his
family will benefit from this

614
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:12,223
in the long run.

615
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,791
Before we even begin,

616
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:33,411
let's have a moment of silence

617
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:37,131
for our dear, brave friend,

618
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,634
James Plouffe.

619
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:57,068
Well, this place is a petri dish now.

620
00:42:57,103 --> 00:43:00,321
Yeah, I'd say we got enough
fingerprints everywhere.

621
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:02,406
So that's it then, right?

622
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:04,575
That's it?

623
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:07,612
That's it?

624
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:10,615
How about, "That's amazing"?

625
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,617
How about we party

626
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:15,286
and thank ourselves for
all the hard work we did?

627
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,766
Yeah, I don't think Trenton
was talking about tonight.

628
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:21,443
- Well, what then?
- Well, you know,

629
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:23,346
I think she's saying after tonight, right?

630
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:26,655
Then what? I mean, what do we all do now?

631
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:30,268
Guys, this isn't about
what we'll do tomorrow!

632
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,969
This is about what we did.

633
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:34,472
I mean, look at all these people.

634
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:38,142
They're free because of us,

635
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:41,812
because of what we did in this room.

636
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:44,732
We're finally awake!

637
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,908
We are finally alive.

638
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,168
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

639
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,061
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

640
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:01,462
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

641
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:02,579
Our streets!

642
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:04,248
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

643
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,133
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

644
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:08,085
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

645
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:10,905
- I know you killed him.
- Our streets!

646
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,193
I know you did it. I know you did it.

647
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,279
Just tell me what happened to Tyrell.

648
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:18,125
- Our streets!
- Shut up!

649
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,534
I have played nice for far too long.

650
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,202
I'm so sick of your whining.

651
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,538
It's not gonna change anything anyway.

652
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,841
Please, you have to do something.

653
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:29,376
You have to help me.

654
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:32,464
- Say something. Make him tell me.
- Stop talking to them!

655
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:34,882
They can't help us.

656
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:37,134
We have to do this together, just us.

657
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:39,887
He's right, you know.

658
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:45,643
You're hurting the
whole family, Elliot.

659
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:48,562
No, no, this isn't my family.

660
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,481
None of them are real.

661
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:52,533
Neither is whoever you're talking to.

662
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:57,821
Then you're not real.

663
00:44:57,823 --> 00:45:00,457
You're not real.

664
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,743
What? You are?

665
00:45:02,745 --> 00:45:05,713
Is any of it real?

666
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:09,500
I mean, look at this. Look at it!

667
00:45:09,502 --> 00:45:12,086
A world built on fantasy!

668
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:13,921
Synthetic emotions in the form of pills,

669
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:17,341
psychological warfare in
the form of advertising,

670
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:20,728
mind-altering chemicals
in the form of food,

671
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,063
brainwashing seminars in the form of media,

672
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:26,433
controlled isolated bubbles
in the form of social networks.

673
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:29,353
Real? You want to talk about reality?

674
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:32,189
We haven't lived in
anything remotely close to it

675
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,607
since the turn of the century.

676
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,442
We turned it off, took out the batteries,

677
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:37,578
snacked on a bag of GMOs

678
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,781
while we tossed the remnants
in the ever-expanding dumpster

679
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:42,616
of the human condition.

680
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:45,285
We live in branded houses
trademarked by corporations

681
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,588
built on bipolar numbers

682
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,541
jumping up and down on digital displays,

683
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:54,128
hypnotizing us into the biggest
slumber mankind has ever seen.

684
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,963
You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo,

685
00:45:55,965 --> 00:45:57,965
before you can find anything real.

686
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:00,384
We live in a kingdom of bullshit,

687
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,636
a kingdom you've lived in for far too long.

688
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:05,973
So don't tell me about not being real.

689
00:46:05,975 --> 00:46:07,608
I'm no less real than
the fucking beef patty

690
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,226
in your...

691
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,894
As far as you're concerned, Elliot,

692
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,613
I am very real.

693
00:46:12,615 --> 00:46:15,649
We are all together now,
whether you like it or not.

694
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:25,659
No! No!

695
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,661
No!

696
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:36,720
I want to be alone.

697
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:38,088
I need to be alone.

698
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:26,239
No, you don't want that, remember?

699
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,891
Remember how you felt
when you were alone?

700
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:32,726
You were in pain.
You were miserable.

701
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:37,147
That's why we're here.

702
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,199
Those lonely nights
when you sat and cried

703
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:43,153
in your apartment, you
begged us to help you.

704
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:45,906
You asked us to come.
You needed us to come.

705
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,292
No!

706
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:51,044
I want you to leave!

707
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:52,329
Leave!

708
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,047
We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

709
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:57,835
You can't leave us,
and we can't leave you.

710
00:47:57,837 --> 00:47:59,386
Ever.

711
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:01,839
It's true, Son.

712
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:10,097
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

713
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:18,739
I'll tell you exactly
what you're gonna do.

714
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,275
You're gonna start listening to us.

715
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:24,444
The world is a better place
because of what we did, Elliot,

716
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:27,581
and you're gonna realize
that one way or another.

717
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,867
Now, here's what I
need you to do now.

718
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:34,755
You're going to walk to the subway.

719
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,296
You're going to get on your train.

720
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:01,949
You're going to get
off at your stop.

721
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,117
Woohoo-hoo-hoo!

722
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:10,490
You're going to go home.

723
00:49:16,332 --> 00:49:18,665
You're gonna sit at your computer,

724
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,834
watch and enjoy the
beautiful carnage

725
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:23,804
that we've all created together.

726
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:27,174
We hope a new society
rises from the ashes,

727
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,343
that you will forge a better world.

728
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,566
- Well, enjoy the evening.
- Thank you.

729
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,789
- How are you?
- Good evening.

730
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,707
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

731
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:27,070
Go ahead. What's on your mind?

732
00:52:27,072 --> 00:52:30,190
I know you're not without your troubles,

733
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:33,860
but we still haven't
discussed the coltan mines.

734
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:36,196
You're really bringing
that up at a time like this?

735
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:39,950
You asked, I answered, succinctly.

736
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:43,203
Well, perhaps I was too hasty.

737
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:46,873
I'd like, for the moment,
to take in the music.

738
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,844
Besides... plenty of
other items on our agenda.

739
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:53,213
The fucking Congo can wait.

740
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:57,801
Oh, your troubles are
weighing heavily on you.

741
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:59,803
I'm not entirely sure why.

742
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:03,023
I was told that you know
the person responsible.

743
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:06,026
Yes. Yes.

744
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:09,896
Of course we do.

745
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:13,150
And we will handle that person

746
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:15,068
as we usually do.

747
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:28,081
- You seem a little preoccupied yourself.
- I don't believe in preoccupation.

748
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:32,085
It's more of an observation.

749
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:35,347
- Which is?
- The infamous Emperor Nero

750
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:39,505
played an instrument very similar
to the one she's playing, the lyre.

751
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:42,692
Legend has it that he played it merrily

752
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:46,600
as he watched...

753
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:52,251
- As he watched?
- As he watched Rome burn.

754
