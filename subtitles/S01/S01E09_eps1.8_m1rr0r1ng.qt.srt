1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:02,715
Exciting time in the world right now.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,343
- Exciting time.
- If you agree to testify,

3
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:07,411
I will testify that I
broke chain of custody

4
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,602
with the .DAT file.

5
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:11,127
We've implemented a honey pot, CS30.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,796
I'd like to look over your findings,

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,798
especially this server.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,883
Detectives came by. They
want to speak with you.

9
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,552
They found a body on the roof.

10
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:20,437
And you both did know the deceased.

11
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,929
Sharon Knowles.

12
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,189
Sharon Knowles?

13
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,968
-  Aah!
- I think the baby's coming.

14
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,321
We got to get her to the hospital.

15
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,012
Tell me about your father.

16
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,464
I remember I tried to hug
him, tell him I'm sorry,

17
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,243
and he shoved me so hard, I
fell backwards out the window.

18
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,697
Oh, my God, Elliot!

19
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:39,331
Did you forget again?
Did you forget who I am?

20
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,650
- I'm your...
-  Sister.

21
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,171
I think we should talk.

22
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,404
It hasn't happened since 1904,

23
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,017
the year John McGraw decided
to take his bat and ball

24
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,375
and go home. Here we are 90 years later,

25
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:01,344
and I want to get your
thoughts on what it was like

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,216
to be without the 1994 World Series.

27
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:07,375
That's right, the 1994
World Series cancelled...

28
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,050
If you would have told me

29
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,854
back in August when the
players voted to walk out

30
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,866
that we would be here where we are today,

31
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,357
I would have told you no way, no how,

32
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:16,392
that's not gonna happen.

33
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:18,144
But hey, if I ever get
it wrong, I admit it.

34
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:20,730
So, what happened? I
want to hear from you...

35
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,609
Mr. Robot.

36
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,763
Um, well, I'd recommend the Pentium 90.

37
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,322
They're lighting fast, and
we've got some in stock now.

38
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:33,466
With an 800 megabyte hard
drive, you'll be all set.

39
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,157
Or we could save you a few bucks

40
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,648
and upgrade what you have.

41
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,191
Once we swap out that motherboard

42
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:41,218
and hard drive, you'll be better than new.

43
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,554
Why don't you bring it on
by, and we'll take a look.

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,662
Okay.

45
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,773
Thank you.

46
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:48,642
Bye-bye.

47
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:51,204
What happened? That new
mouse not work out for you?

48
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,397
Your son, he stole money from me.

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,982
Uh, excuse me?

50
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,177
Your son stole money from
me. I pulled out my wallet,

51
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,487
and I specifically
remembered I had three 20s.

52
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:01,878
Now I only have one.

53
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:03,540
I used one to pay for the mouse,

54
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:04,824
and then I had two left.

55
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,544
Your son was standing right behind me

56
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,579
when I had my money out on the counter.

57
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,164
I... just calm down.

58
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,763
I'm sure there's an explanation for this.

59
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,084
I don't want an explanation.

60
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,892
The only thing I want from you is my money

61
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,284
and a f... ING apology.

62
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,508
There's no need for that.

63
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,116
I'm just trying to figure it out.

64
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,892
Can you tell how much of
a shit I give about that?

65
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,368
Ugh. I don't have time for this.

66
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:29,599
Are you giving me my money or not?

67
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,485
Look, do the right thing here, guy.

68
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,977
Then, no.

69
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,659
Excuse me?

70
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:43,018
The answer's no.

71
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,448
Are you... you being serious right now?

72
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:53,724
I can't help you.

73
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:58,762
You... you're really just
gonna sit there and lie?

74
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:01,265
I should call the cops!

75
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,115
What an example you're setting.

76
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:06,803
I... I earn my money,

77
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,106
and you're just teaching him how to steal.

78
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,558
You're a terrible father.

79
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,143
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

80
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,728
You're a nobody.

81
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,949
You're a middle-aged man doing

82
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:20,725
what my retarded nephew could do.

83
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,284
That's your life.

84
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,343
You know what? Keep your 20.

85
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:29,702
I'll just go to Best Buy from now on.

86
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,076
God...

87
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,787
Come on out.

88
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,862
Dad, I didn't do it.

89
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,336
Let me see it.

90
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:42,307
"Timecop" or "Stargate"?

91
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,536
What? 20 bucks ought
to cover the both of us.

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,084
"Pulp Fiction"? Never heard of it.

93
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,281
Sure I can take you to that?

94
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,973
All right, get your jacket.

95
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,227
What?

96
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,929
How come I'm not in trouble?

97
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,201
Even though what you did was wrong,

98
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:44,345
you're still a good kid,

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,236
and that guy was a prick.

100
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:50,847
Sometimes that matters more.

101
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,079
Come on, let's go. It starts in 15 minutes.

102
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,987
I want to get some popcorn. Come on.

103

104
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:45,521
It's really him.

105
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,854
It's really you.

106
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,405
Never been to your apartment before.

107
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,681
It's nice.

108
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:12,025
A little messy, but that's
not Earth-shattering news.

109
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,884
You never really did
like cleaning your room.

110
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,782
Jesus f... ING Christ.

111
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,952
I can't believe it's really you.

112
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,649
I was beginning to wonder how long

113
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,485
it was gonna take before you recognized me.

114
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:38,241
The fact that you stopped
recognizing Darlene too, well...

115
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,794
I got to be honest, that's
a little disconcerting.

116
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,883
Why didn't you say anything?

117
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,652
- Why didn't you tell me?
-Okay, Elliot...

118
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,896
This whole time?

119
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:52,422
Elliot, you are not well.

120
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:57,233
I was trying to handle it gently.

121
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,357
Gently?

122
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,299
Gently?

123
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:04,025
Gently?

124
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,103
Is that what the last
three months have been?

125
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,608
No. It's been about us
doing something important,

126
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:16,412
and that's what it still needs to be about.

127
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,498
You died.

128
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,417
You died.

129
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,252
You're dead!

130
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,051
I suggest you lower your voice.

131
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,074
Lower my voice?

132
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,600
You want me to lower my voice
after appearing at my door

133
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:41,804
20 years after your supposed death?

134
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:49,846
I think this is a perfect f... ING volume!

135
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,670
Elliot, you don't want them to hear us.

136
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,106
Especially after my impromptu visit from

137
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,298
Tyrell Wellick last night.

138
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,029
Elliot, there are people out there

139
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,886
who do not want us to work together.

140
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,591
Is that why they've been following me?

141
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:22,812
Is that why, because of you?

142
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,932
Think about it. You don't remember me.

143
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,017
You don't remember your
own God damn sister.

144
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,521
You see that shrink, pop their pills.

145
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,606
They intentionally put
you in this haze, fog,

146
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,775
or whatever brain matter
you have left in there,

147
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:38,828
so you forget what they want you to forget.

148
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,947
They're trying to control you, Elliot.

149
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,833
They've been trying to
control you all along.

150
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:47,036
This is crazy. I'm crazy.

151
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm crazy. You're crazy.

152
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,516
This is crazy.

153
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,457
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,459
Who's trying to control me?

155
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,712
The people out there
who don't want me alive.

156
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,849
The people who are afraid of us.

157
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:03,352
We have to be more
careful, now more than ever.

158
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:08,558
And Darlene, she knew about this?

159
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,561
Elliot, I will explain everything,

160
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:16,255
but right now, tonight, we
have to stick to the plan.

161
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,067
Are you kidding me?

162
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,570
You want me to put this on hold?

163
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,905
Are you out of your God damn mind?

164
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,181
It's not safe to discuss this here.

165
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,245
I don't give a shit!

166
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,747
Tell me what the f... is going on.

167
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:38,588
All right. Come on, let's go.

168
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,922
Where?

169
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,011
You want answers?

170
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:47,563
Stop asking questions and follow me.

171
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:01,547
Oh, that's sweet. I... I can't.

172
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,132
You're going too fast.

173
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:05,445
Trust me, don't think that's the problem.

174
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,603
Hey.

175
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,996
I know you didn't want to talk last night.

176
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,118
No, Harry, I can't right now.

177
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:13,893
- I have to...
- Breathe...

178
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,445
and have some breakfast in bed with me.

179
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,160
How are you enjoying anything like that?

180
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,526
Mm.

181
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,017
Honey, I appreciate it.

182
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:41,564
I... God, if you only knew.

183
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,172
Tell me. I would love to know.

184
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:44,443
They hacked us. You know that.

185
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,261
It's all over the news.

186
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,521
Now, normally a company
can get through this,

187
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,213
but we're a cyber security company.

188
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:54,732
Can you appreciate how bad that is?

189
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,959
We're hanging on by our fingernails.

190
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,388
Ugh, who knows?

191
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:04,754
Maybe we've already fallen off a cliff,

192
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,644
and I'm still trying to
grasp on to something.

193
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,216
I'm a failure.

194
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,444
Look at me.

195
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,815
Look at this person who loves you so much

196
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,673
he would die a happy
man right now just 'cause

197
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:33,990
he had this, us, sitting
down and having breakfast.

198
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:37,573
I don't think failing looks like this.

199
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,522
Make sure you go through
all those emails again,

200
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,120
everything from '91 to '95,

201
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,611
and let's start building a table

202
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,479
that cross-references our calendar.

203
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,922
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, good to see you.

204
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,785
Oh, you should be proud.

205
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,813
News of Colby's confession
is breaking today.

206
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:09,392
So far we are firing on
all cylinders, so what's up?

207
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:12,094
I came to help out.

208
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,329
Yeah, can you rescan these
and email the .PDFs to me

209
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,548
and copy Ry on them?

210
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,138
Shouldn't you be at work?

211
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:23,996
I quit.

212
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,260
Angela, you can't work here.

213
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,902
Why not? I gave up
everything for this case.

214
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,621
I don't want you to.

215
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:42,268
I am not here to help you
find purpose in your life.

216
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,743
If you need something to
do, take a jewelry class,

217
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:48,302
but you can't work here.

218
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,611
After what I did,

219
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,506
I won't be able to find
another job in tech.

220
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm broke.

221
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,740
The lawsuit money won't come in for years.

222
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,933
Which is why you need to
find something you can get.

223
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,720
But this is not it,

224
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:03,969
not at this level for
what we're trying to do.

225
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,321
Hello?

226
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,712
John. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:10,269
No, tell me.

228
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,938
Um... four?

229
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,274
No, no, no, we're not going down that road.

230
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,992
Absolutely not.

231
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,528
It's not happening.

232
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,770
No, it's gonna be six or nothing.

233
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:29,565
- Who is this?
- It's me.

234
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,016
I'm looking for Elliot. He's not at work.

235
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,154
I think he's flipping out
again.  What do you mean?

236
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,378
He tried to kiss me last night.

237
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:41,423
You're the one that found him
last time he was like this.

238
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:46,418
I really need your help.

239
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,832
Okay, where are you?

240
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,945
It says so right here on the...

241
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

242
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:55,648
Wow.

243
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,621
He's not here.

244
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,646
Let's keep thinking then.

245
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:12,648
I have been.

246
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,503
This was our runaway hideout.

247
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,270
He always came here.

248
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:20,523
Okay, let's spitball together.

249
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,826
I can't help you.

250
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,695
What does that mean?

251
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:30,666
It means... I don't really
know Elliot any more.

252
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,286
He has gone psycho legit this time, Angela.

253
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,037
We are in a state of 911.

254
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,789
We just need to talk to him.

255
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,518
Yeah, well, he doesn't want to talk back.

256
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,460
And if he does, it's
usually with a bunch of lies.

257
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:44,900
We can't keep protecting
him from himself, Darlene.

258
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,800
He has saved our asses multiple times,

259
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,851
and you're just gonna do him like this?

260
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,971
Why do you even care?

261
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,556
What is that supposed to mean?

262
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,392
It means you guys were never that close.

263
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,227
In fact,

264
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,399
he's been doing just fine until
you moved back to the city.

265
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:05,902
Why are you even here?

266
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:09,004
Why have you and Elliot been
spending so much time together?

267
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,213
Okay, you need to back off, babe.

268
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:13,492
He is my brother, and
I'm just trying to help.

269
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,488
That requires no explanation.

270
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:17,574
You don't want to tell me
what's really going on here,

271
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,917
that's fine, but then
stop asking me for my help.

272
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:49,328
I think we're good.

273
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,520
Remember this?

274
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,654
Of course I do.

275
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,221
I think it's reasonable for
me to confirm given your...

276
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:59,232
I even remember my game.

277
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,707
I'd calculate the statistical probability

278
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,293
of safety for each car on the train

279
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:07,296
based on how often they would derail.

280
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,465
On the way there, I'd
always pick the safest car

281
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:13,803
'cause I looked forward to
our trips to the city so much.

282
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:18,975
Then on the way back, I'd
pick the most dangerous ones...

283
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,477
'cause I hated going home.

284
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,214
She's not there any more, Elliot.

285
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,125
Look, I don't know where we're going,

286
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,599
but we need to find Darlene.

287
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,290
- They may be after her...
- Shh.

288
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,427
I thought that was you.

289
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:48,642
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you in forever.

290
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,844
We can't see Darlene right now.

291
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:58,681
It's too risky.

292
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,400
I know you're confused,
Elliot, but I'm gonna show you.

293
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:06,594
I'm gonna show you exactly
where I've been this whole time.

294
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,514
Look, calm down.

295
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,673
I'll figure this out.

296
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,374
I know you don't trust me.

297
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,293
I wouldn't either, but I'm telling you,

298
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,046
I'm remembering more and
more now as time goes on.

299
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:31,881
That's a plus.

300
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,550
It's all starting to come back,

301
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,218
and once we get all the answers,

302
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,522
I'll be back to normal,

303
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,691
except for the fact that my dead father

304
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:45,227
isn't really dead and is
sitting across from me.

305
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm gonna step outside and give you guys

306
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,592
a moment to yourselves.

307
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,488
We'll try feeding him again later, okay?

308
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,313
Okay.

309
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:21,705

_

341
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:48,832
We're not letting anybody through.

342
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,776
- No, I know the owner.
- Freddy, are you okay?

343
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,321
Is everyone okay? What the hell happened?

344
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,629
I'm still trying to
figure that one out myself.

345
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,270
I was gone one day upstate.

346
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,911
They're saying it was
electrical, but who knows?

347
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,469
On hold with the insurance.

348
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:02,661
Cocksuckers are doing their typical dance.

349
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,616
Yeah, I was on hold?

350
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,827
No, wait... not again.

351
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,989
Well, I just came by to pick up some drives

352
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:12,631
one of my employees dropped off yesterday.

353
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm sorry you wasted the trip.

354
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,569
Everything's gone.

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,534
Tyrell.

356
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,785
What was it?

357
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,037
Boy?

358
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,123
Yeah.

359
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,541
Good.

360
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,126
Thank you for the flowers, sir.

361
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,508
If I'm being honest, it was Anwar

362
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,714
who sent the flowers.

363
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,550
He has a way with them.

364
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,857
Tyrell, you don't know me
to beat around the bush,

365
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:59,059
so I'll get right to it.

366
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,729
Have a seat.

367
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:07,368
You understand the delicate
state we're in these days.

368
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,570
As I'm sure you're aware, this situation

369
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:13,374
with Sharon Knowles is... it's horrific.

370
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:17,044
Scott is understandably devastated by it.

371
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,917
Yeah, my heart goes out to him.

372
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:19,934
I don't know what I'd do if...

373
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,460
- Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but...

374
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:26,253
The thing is that the police

375
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:30,257
have indicated to Scott and to me

376
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:35,396
that you are a person of interest.

377
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:38,098
They're suspicions are
based on information Scott

378
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,771
gave them about advances
you made on Sharon?

379
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,798
Look, Tyrell, it was not lost on me

380
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:50,611
that you and Scott had your
own competitive frictions.

381
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:54,415
Hell, the man nabbed CTO
right out from under you.

382
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,534
I'm sure his distress is
just causing him to lash out,

383
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,536
and you're an easy target for him,

384
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,457
and of course I doubt you're
involvement in this mishap,

385
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:06,510
but... but...

386
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:13,388
The problem remains.

387
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:18,605
Scott will continue here,

388
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:22,461
but you, I'm afraid, can not.

389
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,577
I'm not sure what you're saying, Phillip.

390
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:49,002
You know exactly what I'm saying.

391
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:55,476
Phillip, you can't do this.

392
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,845
You can't do this.

393
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,513
You can't!

394
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,515
I've killed myself for this company!

395
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:04,485
I've been promoted faster than anyone else!

396
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:09,690
You know, I can't deny I tried picturing

397
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,493
your reaction.

398
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:15,442
I seldom have time for such imaginings.

399
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,174
For you, I was curious.

400
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,166
It could've gone any number of ways,

401
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,202
and I found all the different
versions quite interesting,

402
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,038
I admit, but now...

403
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,376
confronted with the reality...

404
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,449
I have to say I'm disappointed.

405
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,908
Phillip, please don't do this.

406
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,683
I was on a track.

407
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,899
There was a moment, Tyrell,

408
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:56,236
a point in your recent past,

409
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,621
a mistake,

410
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,623
a compulsion, decision,

411
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:05,378
something, that led you
to this point right now.

412
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,520
My only advice to you is...

413
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:11,547
find that moment,

414
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:16,139
understand it.

415
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:18,000
It's the only way to reconcile this...

416
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:22,827
this failure with yourself.

417
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:27,168
Please, sir, don't do this.

418
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:30,172
I'm begging you.

419
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:38,056
I... I love this company.

420
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:04,070
Mr. Wellick, you can't keep ignoring us.

421
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,857
If you have any questions,
contact my lawyer.

422
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:10,444
If you have evidence against me, charge me.

423
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,863
I know I brought you back to township,

424
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:24,222
but stopping by our old
house is not part of the plan.

425
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,480
Come on, these people
are gonna be home soon.

426
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,921
Not the best time for a B and E.

427
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,496
This is where it happened, isn't it?

428
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:33,133
What? Where what happened?

429
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,468
You remember anything about that window?

430
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,861
Come on, Elliot.

431
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:39,585
Like I said, we should go.

432
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,715
Elliot, what are you doing? Calm down.

433
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,621
Aah! Ugh!

434
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,480
- You pushed me out this window.
- Elliot...

435
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,645
You pushed me off the boardwalk.

436
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,203
- Hey, come on.
- No. Maybe you're the one

437
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:49,527
who needs some pushing now.

438
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:51,252
Calm down. It was an accident.

439
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,986
Bullshit! I was eight years old.

440
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,621
You thought I deserved it.

441
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:55,872
- That's what you said, isn't it?
- No, no.

442
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,407
Yeah, right before you pushed me again!

443
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,993
No, no, no, Elliot, you
thought you deserved it.

444
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,995
You felt guilty about this your whole life,

445
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,663
about telling people my secret.

446
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,332
This anger was never at me.

447
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,800
It was at you.

448
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,468
Please, Elliot,

449
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,503
you don't have to be
angry at yourself any more.

450
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:11,671
Just let it go.

451
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,173
Please let it go.

452
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,508
You're right. I was angry.

453
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,177
I was angry at myself.

454
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:22,101
I hated myself for doing what I did to you.

455
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,957
I'm ready to let go.

456
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,147
Aah!

457
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:06,238
Gonna work in the garden a little.

458
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,480
It'd be nice if you wanted to help.

459
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:14,913
Oh, by the way, you didn't tell
me Darlene was back in town.

460
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:17,276
I haven't seen her back here in a while.

461
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,717
What did you say?

462
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:22,087
Darlene. At least, I think it was her.

463
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:26,341
You saw her? Where?

464
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,510
I'm telling you, I did not get notification

465
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:29,893
of the request.

466
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,445
That server needs to remain
a honey pot, off the network.

467
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,765
Sir, I have the request
right here from yesterday.

468
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,219
I'm trying to tell you, Jim,

469
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,161
our network was compromised yesterday.

470
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,518
I did not make the request.

471
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,095
Someone else obviously did,

472
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,993
so you need to take the
server off the network,

473
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,419
or something's gonna happen.

474
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:45,027
I just can't do that, sir.

475
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:46,547
We have specific orders from Tyrell Wellick

476
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,288
to keep the request as is.

477
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,430
That just doesn't make any sense.

478
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,702
Look, I need to speak to your supervisor.

479
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:05,262
Hello?

480
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:07,670
Is anyone here?

481
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,700
Hello?

482
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:27,477
Oh, Jesus.

483
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,488
I ran out of places to look,

484
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,741
so I figured I'd try the
last place he'd ever be.

485
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,993
Struck out again.

486
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:37,027
Oh, God.

487
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:41,122
I haven't been here in years.

488
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:44,901
The new family that just
moved in is so weird,

489
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,427
especially the dad.

490
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:54,429
They didn't really change much.

491
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,982
You okay?

492
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,350
Yeah.

493
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,492
Shit.

494
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:02,681
Weird new dad's back.

495
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:22,374
I'm sorry, by the way.

496
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:25,293
For what?

497
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:30,098
I should be more open
with you, your family.

498
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,379
Okay, okay.

499
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:37,988
Don't get all mushy on me now.

500
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:47,593
Do you see that?

501
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:49,401
Wasn't that Elliot's room?

502
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:00,850
We're almost there. Almost there.

503
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,681
Why... Why are we here?

504
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,683
I thought you said we
were going somewhere safe.

505
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,719
Aah!

506
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:09,888
Elliot!

507
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,723
Elliot!

508
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:13,502
Shit.

509
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:16,144
What the hell are they doing here?

510
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:18,303
Won't be long now.

511
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:19,758
I tried to protect you, son,

512
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:21,316
but they caught up to us.

513
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:23,889
- Elliot!
- What are you talking about?

514
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:26,381
That's Darlene and Angela.

515
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:29,374
Trust me, son, I wanted to tell you sooner.

516
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,743
Things got too accelerated
at the end there.

517
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:33,718
You have to believe that.

518
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:36,748
No matter what anyone tries
to do, I will never leave you.

519
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,716
I will always be right here.

520
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:40,335
Do you understand that? They
are not going to break us

521
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:41,905
apart again. What's going on?

522
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,283
- Listen to me.
- Tell me right now!

523
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,056
Listen to me because
we don't have much time.

524
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,159
They're gonna try and get rid of me again,

525
00:32:46,184 --> 00:32:47,736
and I need you to not let them!

526
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:49,177
Why would they get rid of you?

527
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,345
Please, Elliot, listen to me.

528
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,348
I will never leave you.

529
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,809
I will never leave you alone again.

530
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:01,302
I love you, son.

531
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,758
What's he talking about?

532
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,316
What's he talking about?

533
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:18,566
Hey, I want to know.

534
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,791
I want to know.

535
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:23,100
I want to know!

536
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:26,799
Elliot, who are you talking to?

537
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,023
What do you mean? I'm talking to...

538
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:45,299
Stay back. Stay back.

539
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,831
Elliot, you're bleeding.

540
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:52,577
Aah.

541
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:54,435
Elliot...

542
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,401
Aah.

543
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,826
Elliot, what are you doing here?

544
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:09,853
You didn't see him?

545
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:13,046
Who?

546
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,538
Aah!

547
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,181
This can't be happening.

548
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:18,683
This can't be happening.

549
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:21,069
- This can't be happening.
- No...

550
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:31,503
This is happening, isn't it?

551
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,940
You knew all along, didn't you?

552
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:53,108
Elliot, who do you think
you've been talking to?

553
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,588
You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?

554
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:05,371
I'm Mr. Robot.

555
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:25,207
You're gonna be okay.

556
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:28,434
I think I'm pretty f... ING far from okay.

557
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,011
Don't take this the wrong way,

558
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,836
but I envy you.

559
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:43,864
I wish I could talk to my mom again,

560
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,223
even if she isn't real.

561
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:12,568
Take care of yourself, okay?

562
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:29,327
I know you don't feel
like talking about it...

563
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:31,996
- You're right, I don't.

564
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:35,417
Unfortunately I need to know, Elliot,

565
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:38,554
given what we've been doing.

566
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:41,868
I just need to know.

567
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,647
Do you remember any of it?

568
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,302
Remember what?

569
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:55,717
When we first started F Society.

570
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:06,056
Is Mr. Wellick in?

571
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,582
Oh, hi, Mr. Goddard.

572
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:10,291
No, he's gone.

573
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:11,753
He was, um...

574
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:13,548
He was let go today.

575
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:17,625
What? Why?

576
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,901
I don't know.

577
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,627
He wasn't always the
easiest person to deal with.

578
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:23,965
I... I'm sure.

579
00:37:23,977 --> 00:37:28,947
Uh, do you think you can get
me in to see Scott Knowles?

580
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:33,441
- It's urgent.
- Oh, no, definitely not now.

581
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:35,310
You haven't heard?

582
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:07,803
Dad, what's going on?

583
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:11,160
I'll let you two talk.

584
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:19,607
I know, I know, but hey, you
popped in over at my home.

585
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:22,690
I figured I'd return the favor.

586
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,553
What do you want?

587
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:27,278
To offer you something you may want.

588
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,281
Come on in.

589
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,783
If this is about the case...

590
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,178
- Please. I don't care about the case.

591
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:34,369
I don't even understand the case.

592
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:36,371
I have lawyers for that.

593
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,673
Then what?

594
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:43,389
You boys can wait outside.

595
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:52,097
So I got to be honest,
I was impressed by you.

596
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,988
Sure, your career's finished,

597
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:56,104
but you played a great short game.

598
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:58,763
You took a big gamble, and
you got what you wanted.

599
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:02,005
It was just, you know,
the wrong thing to want.

600
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,942
What do you care?

601
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:13,885
You know, I looked into
you over there at Allsafe.

602
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,689
I mean, lots of people

603
00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:17,470
would've settled into
middle management bliss

604
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,746
after all the shit you've taken,

605
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:20,151
but you didn't.

606
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:22,032
You're relentless and
smart, and that combination

607
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:26,095
is very valuable to a
lot of important people,

608
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,423
people I know.

609
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:31,612
Where are you going with all of this?

610
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:37,330
I think I can land you
a pretty lucrative gig.

611
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,104
A gig? Where?

612
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:46,971
Your favorite place, where else?

613
00:39:49,746 --> 00:39:53,448
You slummed it all the way
down to Jersey in person

614
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,785
to offer me a job at the
company I'm currently suing?

615
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,977
What's the real ask here?

616
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,123
I think you'd make a great business woman.

617
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:05,401
I'm afraid it's nothing more than that.

618
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,384
- Is this a joke?
-  It's no joke.

619
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,073
My pals think you can
bring a lot to the table.

620
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:11,298
You can't be offering me a job there.

621
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,300
You're testifying against them.

622
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:15,163
So, you'll find this out fairly soon,

623
00:40:15,188 --> 00:40:18,305
but in business, grudges
aren't really a thing.

624
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,696
It's too emotional.

625
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,388
It's because you pulled off

626
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,337
what you pulled off that they called me.

627
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:26,447
This is a huge class action lawsuit.

628
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:28,472
They are going to pay millions.

629
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:30,979
Roughly 75 to 100 million.

630
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:33,377
I mean, that's what their
lawyers will settle for

631
00:40:33,402 --> 00:40:35,683
after they exhaust most
of your legal team's funds

632
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,741
for the next seven years.

633
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,466
And sure, that is... that's a lot of money,

634
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,608
but not to them, not really.

635
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,357
We started a rainy-day fund

636
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,833
when the leak happened
just for this occasion.

637
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:49,364
The fund itself has already
made five times that amount.

638
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:59,734
I'd like to ask you to leave.

639
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,125
Shall I pass your name along then?

640
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,933
I'm not working there.

641
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:04,518
They killed my mother.

642
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,353
And every fast food joint around the corner

643
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:08,996
delivers diabetes to millions of people.

644
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:11,669
Phillip Morris hands out lung
cancer on the hour, every hour.

645
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:13,084
I mean, hell,

646
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:16,482
everyone's destroying the planet
beyond the point of no return.

647
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,966
Are you really gonna start
taking all of these things

648
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:20,107
so personally?

649
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:21,664
Maybe I will.

650
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:23,222
Maybe someone has to.

651
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,257
If you want to change things,

652
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:30,952
perhaps you should try from within,

653
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:36,230
because this is what
happens from the outside.

654
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,079
These guys don't wait on anyone,

655
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,554
so you'll have to let
them know by tomorrow.

656
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:43,951
I'll show myself out.

657
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:11,239
These are all empty.

658
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:16,778
Are you just filling them and dumping them?

659
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:19,754
Where are your new 'scrips?

660
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:22,450
What does it matter?

661
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:28,089
I don't even know what's real any more.

662
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,271
Look, I know you feel shitty right now,

663
00:42:31,296 --> 00:42:32,627
but once you take your meds...

664
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:35,904
- Maybe we should stop it, Darlene.

665
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,133
Stop what?

666
00:42:38,158 --> 00:42:39,991
The plan.

667
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,553
The hack. Everything.

668
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:43,805
Maybe we shouldn't execute it.

669
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:46,141
What? Why?

670
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,974
The minute our infected server
gets back on the main network,

671
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,980
we're set. It wasn't me.

672
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:57,619
The whole time, it wasn't
really me doing all of that.

673
00:42:57,654 --> 00:43:02,791
Elliot, the reasons we wanted to do this,

674
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:05,126
the reasons why we all wanted to do this,

675
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:08,010
are real.

676
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:12,537
Maybe you don't realize
this, but this was your idea.

677
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:16,231
You came up with this.

678
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:19,368
There is a part of you.
Somewhere deep down inside,

679
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:22,727
that knows this is the right thing to do.

680
00:43:26,635 --> 00:43:28,493
I'm gonna get your meds.

681
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:30,685
We'll talk more when I get back, okay?

682
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:37,655
Come on.

683
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:49,717
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

684
00:43:49,742 --> 00:43:52,776
I know. I know, I'm officially crazy,

685
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:57,260
but the plan isn't, is it?

686
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,299
What the hell are you...

687
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:07,706
Shh.

688
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:27,411
I've been waiting outside
your apartment until she left.

689
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:30,604
Didn't want anyone to know I'm here.

690
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,579
I know you're behind it,

691
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:36,705
all of it, F Society, the server,

692
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:39,088
Colby, Allsafe.

693
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:42,564
You're the one constant
in a sea of variables.

694
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:54,198
Elliot...

695
00:44:54,223 --> 00:44:58,634
now, I don't know what your grand plan is,

696
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:00,942
but I need to, and you're going to tell me.

697
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:17,808
Two days ago I strangled a woman
to death just with my hands.

698
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,801
That's a strange sensation.

699
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,375
Something so tremendous done

700
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,401
by something so simple.

701
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:38,187
The first ten seconds
were... uncomfortable,

702
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:40,846
a feeling of limbo,

703
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,831
but then your muscles tense,

704
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:46,321
and she struggles and fights,

705
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:48,323
but it almost disappears in the background

706
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:52,961
along with everything else in the world.

707
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:58,666
At that moment it's just
you and absolute power,

708
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:03,400
nothing else.

709
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,792
That moment stayed with me.

710
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:14,852
I thought I'd feel guilty
for being a murderer,

711
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:19,496
but... I don't.

712
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:21,854
I feel wonder.

713
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:47,340
How long has this been going on?

714
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:49,585
I don't know.

715
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:58,726
And what is it that you're doing exactly?

716
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:02,730
Encrypting all the files.

717
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,922
All of Evil Corp's financial records

718
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:07,569
will be impossible to access.

719
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:09,388
The encryption key will self-delete

720
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:11,239
after the process completes.

721
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:12,380
What about the backups?

722
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:14,371
I took care of that too.

723
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,063
Chainang. Steel Mountain.

724
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,474
Of course, even when we went redundant.

725
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:21,883
I hacked the Air Dream network.

726
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,335
I was in all of them.

727
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:28,339
You really thought of everything.

728
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:32,844
Who else was involved?

729
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:35,063
Just me.

730
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:41,248
Well, now it's you and me.

731
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:44,441
I've always told you we'd end
up working together, Elliot.

732
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:52,725
But still, I have to know.

733
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,384
Why did you do it?

734
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:01,484
What did you hope to
accomplish by doing all of this?

735
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:08,643
I don't know.

736
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:19,104
I wanted to save the world.

737
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:29,413
