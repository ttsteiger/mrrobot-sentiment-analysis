1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,003
I will be the youngest executive
this company has ever seen.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,009
All right, you know, I'll take
it if you leave us alone.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,525
All right? Thank you.
Check track two out.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,364
- I will, track two.
- All right, man.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,530
Why didn't you tell me
about the DAT file?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,524
Worked at Evil Corp
his whole life.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,161
Then out of the blue, he got fired.
No one knew why.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,886
He had leukemia. Made me
swear to never tell anyone.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,726
Finally, I got so worried,
told my mom.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,245
And when he found out,
he got pissed.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,560
You ever
think you deserved it?

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,165
I was eight years old.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,568
You didn't commit to the
sacred pact you had formed.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,041
<i>My approach
within our business units,</i>

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,488
<i>is to first invest in new
technologies and develop prototypes</i>

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,722
<i>in order to understand
the technology potential.</i>

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,930
<i>Because despite the recent success
of our cybersecurity team,</i>

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,684
<i>our company currently still has</i>

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,849
<i>seventy-two potential
hacker vulnerabilities</i>

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,249
<i>in our primary and second...
No, wait a second...</i>

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,329
<i>You stupid piece of shit.</i>

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,607
Again.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
<i>Our company currently still has
73 potential hacker vulnerabilities</i>

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,411
<i>in our primary
and secondary data centers.</i>

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,482
<i>Now is not the time
to be encumbered</i>

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,525
<i>by the company's tragic and
shameful loss of our chief tech...</i>

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,722
<i>Too formal, God damn it!</i>

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,928
Warm it up,
don't be a cold robot.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,321
Again!
Now is not the time

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,609
to be encumbered by the company's
tragic and shameful loss

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,728
of our Chief Technology Officer.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,963
We have to be swift
in naming a replacement CTO.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,408
And, sir, I would like
to suggest it be me.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,770
For the sake of our company

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,121
that we make our decision today.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,531
My promotion...

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,003
My internal promotion shows not
only our confidence as a company,

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,765
but strength in our boldness
to the public.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,170
Thank you for your time.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,204
You will be the next CTO
of this company.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,769
You will be the
next CTO of this company.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,411
You will be
the next CTO of this company.

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,804
You sure you don't want
anything? Pellegrino? Tea?

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,886
Sir, thank you again
for seeing me.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,643
Tyrell, I'm gonna have
to reschedule this.

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,882
- Anwar, set up another time.
- Sir, it's just that I think that...

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,203
I get it, I get it. We'll get another
meeting on the books right away.

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,001
We've got a really good
CTO candidate

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,287
the board is very excited about.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
They're not ready
to discuss it yet.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
We'll loop you in.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,685
Just give us a couple
of weeks. Hmm?

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,326
Uh, put Wellick back
on the books. Two weeks.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,650
Oh, nice tie.

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,408
Let me guess. Brioni?

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,726
Great taste, as always.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,121
Be well.

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,046
I'll email
your assistant the details.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,244
If you could,

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,249
just email it to me directly.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,283
This is too important
for me to miss.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,363
Mr. Wellick, we're here.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,843
Do you think I could have
300 this time?

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,289
Spoken like a true capitalist.

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,170
Bad day at the office?

67
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,006
No kicking...

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,364
Argh. Please.
Enough. No more.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,322
<i>Most coders think debugging
software is about fixing a mistake,</i>

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,764
<i>but that's bullshit.</i>

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,731
<i>Debugging's actually all about
finding the bug.</i>

72
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,284
<i>About understanding why the
bug was there to begin with.</i>

73
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,289
<i>About knowing that its
existence was no accident.</i>

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,889
<i>It came to you
to deliver a message,</i>

75
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,411
<i>like an unconscious bubble
floating to the surface,</i>

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,522
<i>popping with a revelation you've
secretly known all along.</i>

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,411
<i>I don't know
why I'm saying all of this.</i>

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,123
<i>Maybe it's because I'm pumped up on
whatever smack legal drug dealers</i>

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,647
<i>like Eli Lilly make
money off nowadays.</i>

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,331
<i>But usually it's because
there's a sense it's coming.</i>

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,768
<i>A bug buzzing its way towards me</i>

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,209
<i>to gum up the works until it
forces me to make a call.</i>

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,809
<i>"Kill me or embrace me."</i>

84
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,450
<i>Or maybe I'm just freaking out
because I never thought I'd wake up</i>

85
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,046
<i>to find these two women
staring back at me.</i>

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,969
Are you awake?

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,846
I don't know.

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
What are you doing here?

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,208
We talked, maybe a few hours
ago when I first got here.

90
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,851
You don't remember?

91
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,526
They said I was your
emergency contact.

92
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,326
Um, all right. Um...

93
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,402
You told them to call
your psychiatrist.

94
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,122
You can't leave until
you talk to one.

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,089
So I'm gonna wait outside.

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,521
Hey.

97
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,368
Do you remember requesting me
from the staff?

98
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,567
You requested me because
the police said that...

99
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,211
I got jumped by a bunch of kids.

100
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,891
It's not the end of the world.

101
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,240
They wanted to do a full
drug panel and you refused.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,526
May I ask why?

103
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,926
Elliot, if we can't have
a conversation about this...

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,164
I've been taking morphine.

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,601
Why?

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,081
I don't have a good enough
reason to give you.

107
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,087
I Wish I did, but I don't.

108
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,964
Maybe we should consider rehab.

109
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,531
I'm not a junkie.

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,886
Then you'll need
to prove it to me.

111
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,531
Submit to a bimonthly
drug test. Voluntarily.

112
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,762
That's the only way that
I'll recommend your release.

113
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,524
<i>Hospitals, a heavily
networked one like this</i>

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,364
<i>are almost too easy to hack.</i>

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,410
<i>This is William Highsmith.</i>

116
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,284
<i>He's not only the head
of the IT department here,</i>

117
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,323
<i>he is the IT department.</i>

118
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,371
<i>He's also an idiot.</i>

119
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,411
<i>Not that I blame him because the
people that hire him are also idiots.</i>

120
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,970
<i>The poor guy only gets a budget
of about 7,000 bucks a year.</i>

121
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,163
<i>And he's supposed to protect their
network from people like me?</i>

122
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,083
<i>He never stood a chance.</i>

123
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,687
<i>He uses useless virus scans, dated
servers, and security software</i>

124
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,922
<i>that runs on Windows 98.</i>

125
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,681
<i>It's one of the reasons why I made
this place my primary care facility.</i>

126
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,570
<i>I can make my health records look like
every other obedient zombie out there.</i>

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,964
Okay. You don't
have to worry.

128
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,328
I'm not going to do
morphine again.

129
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,802
That's a nice breakfast.

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,008
Sorry, credit card system
is down.

131
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,766
<i>Like I said, the most
difficult thing about debugging</i>

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,683
<i>isn't fixing the bug,</i>

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,603
<i>it's all about finding the bug.</i>

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,489
<i>For Evil Corp, Mr. Robot
found that bug in me.</i>

135
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,011
<i>I was the mistake
that led to all of this.</i>

136
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,406
<i>I have to ask
you one thing.</i>

137
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,441
Did you have something to do
with Vera getting busted?

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,890
Shit, Elliot.

139
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,522
You said you weren't
gonna do anything.

140
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,650
He's on murder charges,
do you know that?

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,483
His whole crew bounced.
I mean, I...

142
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,165
I don't know what I'm
gonna do for money now.

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,928
Just tell me, Elliot.

144
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,805
And don't lie.

145
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,401
Did you do something?

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,247
No.

147
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,241
Hmm.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,885
Hey.

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,561
Hey.

150
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,925
Are you okay?

151
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,560
- I mean with everything that
happened to... - I'm fine.

152
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,246
What happened to your door?

153
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,851
You're not supposed to be here.

154
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,570
Okay, I changed the locks
for a reason.

155
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,681
Mmm.

156
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,004
Interesting toy,

157
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,923
but you may want to spend a little more
scratch if you actually want it to,

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,445
you know, work.

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,606
Check it,

160
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,604
Jessica Alba says she wants
to join fsociety.

161
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,250
Jesus, what happened
to your face?

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,286
What's going on?

163
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,051
Well, I'm not
the princess of social graces,

164
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,965
but typically it goes
something like,

165
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
"Hi, this is Darlene..."

166
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,361
Stop.

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,041
You need to leave.

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,888
Babe, seriously, we have a lot of shit
to discuss, so if you wouldn't mind...

169
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,961
Get out.

170
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,289
I suggest you get a grip.

171
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,129
I mean, what was
she talking about?

172
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,725
I gotta get to work.

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Work? Are you serious?
You can't go to work.

174
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,641
You have to call in sick.

175
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,486
I have to go.

176
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,088
<i>A bug is never
just a mistake.</i>

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,842
<i>It represents something bigger.</i>

178
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,844
<i>An error of thinking...</i>

179
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,247
Sir!

180
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,163
<i>...that makes you who you are.</i>
Sir! Sir!

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,447
Sir, you
dropped your wallet!

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
Thanks.
Sure.

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,290
Stop! Stop!
He stole my purse!

184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,601
That was your wallet?

185
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,489
Yes, that was my wallet
you just gave him.

186
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,921
Stop!

187
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,287
He got
into my system.

188
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,283
And he wants me to put the CD on
one of the computers at work.

189
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,646
<i>Why does he wanna do that?</i>

190
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,848
I don't know, Stella,

191
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,365
he didn't give me
a full explanation.

192
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,760
<i>So, he's got naked pics of me?</i>

193
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,491
Is that the only thing you're seriously
taking away from this conversation?

194
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,481
Hey, babe.

195
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,601
Hey.

196
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,966
How was your run?

197
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,400
Strange.

198
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,170
Someone dropped their wallet.

199
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,323
And I picked it up to give
it to them, but then this...

200
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,971
Nothing strange about that, just
shows how good of a person you are.

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,283
Always have been. Almost to a fault.

202
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,641
What does that mean?

203
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,441
Just that you...

204
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,127
You're too good for the world.

205
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,165
That's probably why I love you.

206
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,006
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

207
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,566
I told you I can't talk.

208
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,202
<i>You have 100 hours precisely.</i>

209
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
<i>After that,</i>

210
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,489
everything we own
will be released.

211
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,841
<i>And it's not enough just to
focus your attention on the logs.</i>

212
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,285
We should also monitor social-media
traffic, as well as IRC, Pastebin.

213
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,602
And set up scripts
to keep going 24/7.

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,003
We might get lucky,

215
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,731
we might get sloppy, make a
mistake, you know, catch some...

216
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,290
<i>This is the world
we live in,</i>

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,931
<i>people relying on
each other's mistakes</i>

218
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,409
<i>to manipulate one another,
use one another,</i>

219
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,449
<i>even relate to one another.</i>

220
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,081
<i>The warm, messy circle
of humanity.</i>

221
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,207
Elliot?

222
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm inviting you guys,
uh, to dinner tonight.

223
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,967
Morton's notwithstanding,
I cook a mean steak.

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,650
What? Can't a boss invite his
favorite employees to dinner?

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,525
No, that's cool,
but I got plans.

226
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,642
Can you guys give us a minute?

227
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,164
Yeah.

228
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,051
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

229
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,765
Not really.
Well...

230
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,450
You're missing work,
you come in looking like that,

231
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,971
and you expect me
not to ask questions?

232
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,565
Look, I don't know how much you want
me asking about your personal life.

233
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,483
But...
Not at all, actually.

234
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,842
I mean, I don't mean
to be rude, just...

235
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,846
I'm just being honest.

236
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,001
<i>Mr. Robot may have
found Evil Corp's bug,</i>

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,531
<i>but he didn't find mine.</i>

238
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,248
<i>That's the only way
to protect myself,</i>

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,048
<i>never show them my source code.</i>

240
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,651
<i>Close myself off.</i>

241
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,721
<i>Create my cold, perfect maze
where no one can ever find me.</i>

242
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,684
Elliot! I cannot believe you work here.
This place is a shithole!

243
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,007
Look, I thought I'd
swing by, take you to lunch.

244
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,565
Oh, that's nice.

245
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,089
I think she likes you, bud.

246
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,686
All right, fine, I'll take her.

247
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,491
But let the record show, I was
trying to be a good wing man.

248
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,483
Oh, calm down! Shit.

249
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,563
I'm not that into
redheads anyway.

250
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,007
The whole nation of Ireland
makes my dick soft.

251
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,446
Leave.

252
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,646
Darlene said we need to talk.

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,165
Leave, now.

254
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,446
You're right,
probably shouldn't talk here.

255
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,931
Let's go to that bar next door.

256
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,441
I'm not going anywhere with you.

257
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,330
I'm not going anywhere
until you do.

258
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,369
So, I can hang out here
and create a scene,

259
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,283
or you can give me five
minutes in the bar next door.

260
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,806
Either way, I'm gonna have fun.
Dealer's choice.

261
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,321
Mmm.

262
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,085
What? It's an appletini.

263
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,601
I should kick your ass.

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,728
Mmm. If that'll make us
square, you have my blessing.

265
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,764
Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.
You're a maniac.

266
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,566
What can I get for you?

267
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,807
Uh, nothing.

268
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,967
Uh, you should probably order something.
I'd recommend this.

269
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,081
Fine.

270
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,885
I'll, I'll have a...

271
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,721
Appletini.

272
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,805
You should it as a compliment, guy,
these things are goddamn delicious.

273
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,601
I get it, compliments
make me uncomfortable, too.

274
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,484
You know, I find that hard to believe.

275
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,564
Yeah, who am I kidding?
I love compliments.

276
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,326
$12.

277
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,728
I really don't think you enjoyed that.
I suggest sipping it...

278
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,126
Last chance.

279
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,321
What do you want?

280
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,724
I'm sorry for what I did.

281
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,286
I don't buy it.

282
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,451
More importantly,
I don't give a shit.

283
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,329
Hey, I never wanted to hurt you.

284
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,366
People who get violent, get that way
because they can't communicate.

285
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,001
Your dad...

286
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,846
I bet he felt shitty
for doing what he did.

287
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,089
I'm sure he wanted
to apologize, too.

288
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,168
Sometimes pushing your kid
away is just easier.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,048
Don't stay mad
at him too long, kiddo.

290
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,041
You're leaving?

291
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,048
That's what you want, isn't it?

292
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,525
What about your plan?

293
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,281
Plan?

294
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,051
You're the key
to the whole thing.

295
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,003
Without you, there is no plan.

296
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,081
That's it?

297
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,487
It's over?

298
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,449
You expect me to believe that?

299
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,244
See you in another life.

300
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,971
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

301
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,046
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

302
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,084
<i>Is that really happening?</i>

303
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,283
<i>Fsociety's finally over.</i>

304
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,085
<i>The recent glitch in the otherwise
neat reality I created over the years,</i>

305
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,762
<i>I'll never slip
up like that again.</i>

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,889
<i>I'm gonna be more normal now.</i>

307
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,247
<i>Maybe Shayla could
even be my girlfriend.</i>

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,765
<i>I'll go see those stupid
Marvel movies with her.</i>

309
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
<i>I'll join a gym.</i>

310
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,201
<i>I'll heart things on Instagram.</i>

311
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,761
<i>I'll drink vanilla lattes.</i>

312
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,201
<i>I'm gonna lead
a bug-free life from now on.</i>

313
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,081
<i>Anything to protect
my perfect maze.</i>

314
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,801
Hey, Gideon.

315
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,962
Is that dinner
still on for tonight?

316
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,245
Um, yeah, sure.

317
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,125
Uh, uh, you want...
You want to come?

318
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,801
Yeah.

319
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,841
Great.

320
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,644
Can I bring my girlfriend?

321
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,325
You have a girlfriend?

322
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,651
Well, I haven't
asked her yet, but I will.

323
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,489
Hopefully she'll say "yes."

324
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,847
Uh, yeah, sure.

325
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,921
Perfect.

326
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,321
Thanks.

327
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,842
Was he drinking Starbucks?

328
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,569
Are you still trying
to rip that CD?

329
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,369
Yeah, it's all scratched up.

330
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,884
Let's get outta here.

331
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,323
My boss invited me to a dinner
party at his place tonight.

332
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,360
Thought you could come
as my girlfriend.

333
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,361
What?

334
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,680
Are you actually asking me to
be your girlfriend right now?

335
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,441
Yeah.

336
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,321
Anyway, I need you. I'm not good
in social situations like that.

337
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,767
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

338
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,489
I'm... I'm not
gonna be used anymore.

339
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,608
Why don't you ask the girl
from this morning, okay?

340
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,083
She seems like she might wanna go to
some stupid, stuffy dinner party.

341
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,522
You don't actually know me.

342
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,370
All you know is that I'm...

343
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,408
<i>Of course I know Shayla.</i>

344
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,643
<i>I hacked her email as soon
as she moved in next door.</i>

345
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,491
<i>With a simple phishing scam, I
owned her password pretty easily.</i>

346
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,682
I'm not talking about
the stuff you can find online.

347
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,842
I'm talking about the real me.

348
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,331
Tell me then.

349
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,843
No. Forget it.

350
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,206
I wanna know.

351
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,441
<i>What is this?</i>

352
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,085
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

353
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,523
<i>I've never seen
this before, she must...</i>

354
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,683
...never posted online. Um,
I mean, a lot of 'ems not...

355
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,364
They're not done.

356
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,120
<i>She's got
her own private maze, too.</i>

357
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,966
Took a lot of different pieces,
um, from different things.

358
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,281
From my photographs
or drawings. And...

359
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,643
Like, there's this one.

360
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,569
Um, it's really fucking corny.

361
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,770
But it's like... Has everything.
The kids and the...

362
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,811
<i>Shayla 's bug was
always elusive to me.</i>

363
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,245
<i>Maybe this was it,</i>

364
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,609
<i>wanting normalcy, but stuck
in the outer fringes.</i>

365
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,564
<i>Not knowing how to participate.</i>

366
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,281
<i>Just like me.</i>

367
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,885
Can I kiss you?

368
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,890
Next time, don't ask.

369
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,281
It's lame.

370
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,640
<i>Bugs usually get
a bad rep.</i>

371
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,290
<i>But sometimes...</i>

372
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,931
Don't let me down, okay?

373
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,006
<i>When a bug finally
makes itself known,</i>

374
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,965
<i>it can be exhilarating.</i>

375
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,528
<i>Like you just
unlocked something.</i>

376
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,681
<i>A grand opportunity waiting
to be taken advantage of.</i>

377
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,121
Mr. Wellick?

378
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,761
Hey.

379
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,406
What was your name again?

380
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,606
Anwar.

381
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,283
I didn't know you came
to places like this.

382
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,850
I don't.

383
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,968
What do you mean?
You're here now.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm here because you are.

385
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,647
What? I'm sorry,
I don't get it.

386
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,962
I think you're beautiful.
I wanna take you home.

387
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,644
Wait, I thought
you were married.

388
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,771
<i>Because, after all,
a bug's only purpose,</i>

389
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,730
<i>its only reason for existence,</i>

390
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,326
<i>is to be a mistake
that needs fixing.</i>

391
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,722
<i>To help you right a wrong.</i>

392
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,845
<i>And what feels better than that?</i>

393
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,841
So, Elliot,

394
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,330
do you think you
should introduce us?

395
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, um, Shayla,

396
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,605
Angela and Ollie.

397
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,851
You, uh... You look
lovely this evening.

398
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,926
What up guys?

399
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,365
You just get here?

400
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,846
Nice suit.

401
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,047
Thanks, dude.

402
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,050
What is up with you?

403
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,406
You've been fidgeting all night.

404
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,845
Maybe we should try
the doorbell again.

405
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,364
Hey guys!

406
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,091
How have you been
standing out here?

407
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,328
The doorbell is broken.
I should have warned you.

408
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,329
Come in!
I'm Harry, by the way.

409
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,090
Angela. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

410
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,321
Hey.

411
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,164
Always nice to put a face
with an employee badge number.

412
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,441
Right?

413
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,609
Ollie, how long have
you guys been together?

414
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,844
Uh, two and a half years.
Two years.

415
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,966
Okay.

416
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,327
Elliot, how long have
you and Shayla been together?

417
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,851
Well, uh...

418
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,891
Um, just... Just today.

419
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,121
Okay, enough grilling
of the guests.

420
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,163
Let's check on
the real grill, shall we?

421
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,322
Elliot, I could use your help.

422
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,850
<i>So, I have a confession.</i>

423
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,489
I had the sys admins of the data center
in Dulles check that server again.

424
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,524
<i>Gideon, what did you do?</i>

425
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,211
Of course, there was nothing.

426
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,568
I have no idea what there was
to even be suspicious about.

427
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,770
I mean, what possible motivation
would you have to do anything?

428
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,201
<i>Gideon has to let this go.</i>

429
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,850
<i>If he comes
near this hornet's nest,</i>

430
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,002
<i>I'm not sure
I can save him from it.</i>

431
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,605
<i>I have to kill
any suspicion left.</i>

432
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,487
You've been nothing,
but a hard worker for Allsafe.

433
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,127
So,

434
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,481
I apologize.

435
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,962
After the conversation
on the plane,

436
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,451
I knew what was at stake.

437
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,965
The whole company.

438
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,483
I was worried that the DAT file
I found wasn't the right one,

439
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,451
and I just didn't want to get your
hopes up in case I was wrong.

440
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,561
That's why I didn't tell you
before the meeting.

441
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,322
<i>Shit, I'm gonna have
to let him hug me, aren't I?</i>

442
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,286
You're such
a brilliant engineer, Elliot.

443
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,370
You should never doubt
your skills,

444
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,528
no matter how much
pressure I put on you.

445
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,650
And you certainly don't have
to keep anything from me.

446
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,165
I care about you.

447
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,329
<i>From the Mixed-Up Files
of Basil E. Frankweiler.</i>

448
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,084
That's where I got
the idea, remember?

449
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,371
I wanted to be
Claudia Kincaid so bad.

450
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,204
Even her name was cool.

451
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,082
Remember, we thought we were
going to the Met,

452
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,129
somehow we ended up at the
Queens Museum instead.

453
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,642
No Google Maps back then.

454
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,449
I loved running away with you.

455
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,084
Somehow, when you're eight,
running away can be fun.

475
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,682
<i>of the dangerous

476

484
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,082
<i>There's nothing

485
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,131
<i>I didn't think it existed,

486
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,842

489
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,206
What's going on?

490
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,769
That's how my mom,
um, and Elliot's dad...

491
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,287
I have to go.

492
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,566
Well, wait... Wait,
let me come with you.

493
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,846
No, I'd rather you didn't.

494
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,809
<i>Evidence in the
Washington Township scandal.</i>

495

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,328

499
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,448
<i>Evil Corp is dangerous...</i>

500
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,971
Don't look so sad.

501
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,567
He did this to himself.
He gave in. He was a coward.

502
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,482
He was weak and pathetic,

503
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,806
and, in the end, that's
what killed your father.

504
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,923
Why are you crying?

505
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,891
Don't ask so many questions.

506
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,931
I miss him.

507
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,605
There's no point to that.

508
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,881
But I do.

509
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,363
Then you're just as weak as him.

510
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,966
You're not sad?

511
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,606
Why should I be?

512
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,930
It's a beautiful night.

513
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,606
The weather is nice.

514
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,322
And I'm enjoying my cigarette.

515
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,525
<i>The bug forces

00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,369
<i>the inevitable upgrade.</i>

522
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,481
You're a strange creature.

523
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,803
I'm just a businessman.

524
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,847
And that's about as clean
as I'm gonna get it.

525
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,523
You have to do the rest
in the shower.

526
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,684
I don't mind
being a little dirty.

527
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,326
I do.

528
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,203
You should join me!

529
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,127
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

530
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,401
Hey.

531
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,683
I'm sorry
that I ran off like that.

532
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,161
Did you talk to him?

533
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,925
Nope. He wasn't home.

534
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,161
Well, I'm here.

535
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,170
I want to talk to you about
everything, just not tonight, okay?

536
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,043
So, you'd talk to him,
but not your own boyfriend?

537
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,047
It's different, Ollie.

538
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,804
Both of our parents
died because...

539
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,771
That's how we know each other.

540
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,248
I really don't wanna talk
about this right now.

541
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,766
Well, what if I do?

542
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,771
What if you do what?

543
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,321
Wanna talk!

544
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,884
About...

545
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,321
Something.

546
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,084
What the hell
are you talking about?

547
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,124
I have to tell you something.

548
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,007
I don't know why you're...
You're putting yourself through this,

549
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,321
you don't have to keep
looking at it.

550
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,803
All right? It meant nothing.

551
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,646
Okay, I know I sound like a
broken record, but I love you,

552
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,643
and I wanna be with you.
Stop speaking.

553
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,126
Just tell me what you need
in order for me to fix this,

554
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,565
and I'll do it.

555
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,330
We need to break up.

556
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,125
Angela, come on.

557
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,289
What choice
did you give me, Ollie?

558
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,046
Look, I know I have a problem,

559
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,122
I'm not denying that.
Well maybe my problem is...

560
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,487
I can't be
with a guy with your problem.

561
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,044
Where's the CD?

562
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,361
It's in my...
In my bag. Why?

563
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,209
He has my bank account, Ollie.
And my dad's bank account.

564
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,124
How did they...
Our accounts are linked

565
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,363
because of my student loans. I
used your laptop to access it.

566
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,885
He has my dad's social security,

567
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,724
his credit card numbers,
everything.

568
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,326
Okay.

569
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,404
Okay, that is bad, but I'm... But I'm
sure the cops will figure out a way...

570
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,211
If we don't do what this guy
says and we go to the oops,

571
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,487
then he's just gonna sell our
information to the highest bidder,

572
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,449
and me and my dad
are completely screwed.

573
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,521
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

574
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,881
to come back from massive
identity theft like this?

575
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,245
What are you saying?

576
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,890
Angela? Are you crazy?

577
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,249
No. We cannot just infect Allsafe's
network because of this.

578
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,760
I'll lose my job!

579
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,611
And there it is.

580
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,764
You'll lose your job too,
if that matters.

581
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,246
Besides, even if we put
the CD in,

582
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,808
who says this guy won't
just do all of this anyway?

583
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,926
Hey. Hey, hey.
Come here.

584
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,971
Look at me.

585
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,967
We are going to figure this out.

586
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,280
Okay?

587
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,249
You're right.
You're right.

588
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,767
I'm sorry.
I'm just scared.

589
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,604
I don't wanna break up
with you. I'm sorry that I said that.

590
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,924
I love you so much.

591
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,081
<i>This is Edmond Dulles.</i>

592
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,209
Yeah, hi. This, um, Gideon
Goddard at Allsafe Security.

593
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,366
I need to talk to Sean Skyler
about server CS30 again.

594
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,521
<i>Hold please.
I'll transfer you.</i>

595
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,321
Mmm-hmm.

596
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,004
Here's the plan.
