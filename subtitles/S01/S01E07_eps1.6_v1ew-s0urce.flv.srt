1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,570
So, what do we got?

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,110
Terry Colby was involved in the cover-up of

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,840
Washington Township toxic waste scandal.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,220
What do we need to prove our case?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,780
Someone who was there

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,530
when the decision was made to falsify chemical waste intel.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,910
Get the hell away from my home.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,100
Get away from my home.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,220
Elliot, what is going on with you.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,870
I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,290
We got problems.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,170
The Dark Army is bailing.

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,220
It's not over.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,370
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,160
How do you not blow your brains out being married to him?

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,810
You want to watch me piss too?

17
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,930
Scott, a misunderstand--

18
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,460
Happy to pull my dick out for you, 

19
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,630
Elliot!

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,860
Where is she?

21
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,830
Told you you'd get her back, bro.

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,000
Shit!

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,160
Shit!

24
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,900
Open up!

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm bleeding all over the hallway!

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,880
It's a life-or-death situation out here!

27
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,430
Look, I know you're in there. I just saw you go in.

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,090
Open up!

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm lo--

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,270
Well, are you just gonna stand there?

31
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,470
Get me a glass of water, dummy.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
Can I use this? Thanks.

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,740
My niece gave him to me.

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,240
I haven't even named him yet. God.

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,090
Do you know the pressure of an ecstatic six-year-old?

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,230
I mean, I kill that thing, and her whole world collapses.

37
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,920
I like what you did with the place.

38
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,030
Yeah, nice setup. Still like mine better though.

39
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,200
Yo, let me know if you want a top-shelf hookup.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,010
Actually, now that I have you...

41
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,760
Will you help me move a dresser...Mr. Muscles?

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,390
Okay, come on. Just come on.

43
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,740
Man 'n' van is getting way too legit.

44
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,560
They used to just be, like, drummers

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,980
with their mom's Honda Odysseys.

46
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,510
Now it's an actual company in Queens.

47
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,800
I mean, the guys are literally men in vans.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,900
I'd buy morphine from you,

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,580
if you could also get me suboxone.

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,560
Well, um, it's pretty much impossible to get suboxone.

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,100
My supplier doesn't have it.

52
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,460
I saw this song live once. It was so rad.

53
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,920
Don't you just love hearing your favorite songs in person,

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,460
like, half deaf from the speakers,

55
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,480
everyone going nuts around you?

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
No.

57
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,890
Direct. I respect that.

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,300
I just hate concerts.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,150
Lots of people.

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,930
You don't like people, huh?

61
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,650
Not most of them, no.

62
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,830
Okay.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,070
Well, so by that rationale, 

64
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,130
if you were to really like one person, it'd be, like,

65
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,490
considered an aberration or an abnormality

66
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,680
or special, even.

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,480
I guess.

68
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,680
Well, I aim for special,

69
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,800
so challenge accepted.

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,910
I wish we already knew each other.

71
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,860
Would make this feel less awkward.

72
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,970
You really feel awkward right now?

73
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah.

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,330
Well, then I wish we knew each other too then.

75
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,470
Oh, yikes.

76
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,860
I, um, I'm late. Meeting the girls for drinks.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,240
Oh, um, I'm Shayla.

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,120
Elliot.

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,890
You know, I do know of a guy who sells Suboxone.

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,240
He's supposed to be a fucking psychopath,

81
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,890
but if you want, I can call him.

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,790
You might be worth a psychopath.

83
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,210
I don't know. Maybe.

84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh, and keep the fish, you filthy animal.

85
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,630
Sorry I haven't talked to you in a while.

86
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,780
I mean, it's only been a month, which I guess

87
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,460
in the grand scheme of things isn't that long.

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,260
Isn't our life like a blip

89
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,550
in the cosmic calender or something?

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,770
So that's Shayla.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,010
A blip.

92
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,880
Not even.

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,780
Here one blip, gone the next.

94
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,480
Makes me hate myself that I've already gotten used to

95
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,610
the idea of her not being here.

96
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,370
In a year, I'll maybe think about her

97
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,870
every once in a while.

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,470
Then she'll become an anecdote, a thing to say.

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,610
"I knew a girl that died,"

100
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,250
with the added bonus of, "She died because of me."

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,160
Maybe I should hate myself.

102
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,610
Here are the last two forms.

103
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,070
She's getting rid of me,

104
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,380
in case you're still trying to figure that out.

105
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,110
- Once I... - Sign on the bottom.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Then I'll deliver it to the court,

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
and in two weeks' time, you'll receive

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,400
an official release from the mandate.

109
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,090
That second form means that we've been sitting in this room for a year.

110
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,910
Over 52 hours of Krista's voice bouncing around this room.

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,750
She thinks she's a wasted echo. Maybe she is.

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,610
I wonder how much time I've spent

113
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,510
not listening to her in here.

114
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm worried about you, Elliot.

115
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,160
I really want you to keep coming here.

116
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
We've got a lot more work to do.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,990
She wants more from me

118
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,650
but she doesn't believe in me.

119
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,710
I tried because I believe some part inside of you

120
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,810
wants to do this right.

121
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,900
You?

122
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,050
Are you on her side?

123
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,150
You should clean your sockets.

124
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,490
Sounds too good to be true, but I'll bite.

125
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,160
What's the ask?

126
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,050
Given my client has information

127
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,090
that could help your client's case,

128
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,220
we want the meeting restricted to her, Colby, and myself,

129
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,330
And we want it conducted off-record.

130
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
Antara, come on.

131
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,370
My client won't accept your presence.

132
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,690
Our client pays for ours.

133
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,410
Then you're duty-bound to present him

134
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,510
with any legitimate offer of beneficial evidence.

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,320
Of course.

136
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,020
Give us something truly legitimate and beneficial.

137
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,710
You won't even tell us what the hell your client has.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,970
Seth, we've been sitting on opposite sides

139
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,530
of the negotiating table for two decades.

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,030
I'm not some joker come out of the woodwork

141
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,930
trying to scam Colby for millions.

142
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm giving him the only glimmer of hope he's had.

143
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,290
We'll pass along your offer. Thanks for your time.

144
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,630
Lloyd said you wanted to see me.

145
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,440
Look, I appreciate your commitment to this job.

146
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,730
I really do.

147
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,450
But I don't see how you've plowed through

148
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,620
these last few weeks, so 

149
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,820
I want to offer you some time off.

150
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,100
- Just some time to-- - I don't need time off.

151
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,970
I'm good.

152
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,070
Uh...Uh, one more thing.

153
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm so sorry she was taken away, Elliot,

154
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,190
but don't let her death close you off entirely.

155
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,320
Find someone you can be your honest self with, 

156
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,450
okay?

157
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,750
I remember when I was a kid, I got into web design

158
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,100
by ripping off sites I liked.

159
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,260
All you had to do was view source on your browser

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,560
and there it was, the code.

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,970
You could copy-paste it, modify it a little,

163
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,740
Put your name on it, and like that, it was your site.

165
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,370
View source.

166
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,650
What if we had that for people?

167
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,890
Would people really want to see?

174
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,680
Find someone to be your honest self with?

175
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,920
Bullshit.

176
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,540
Really good advice. Thanks.

177
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,360
I quote, "The U.S. contingent of the hacker group fsociety

178
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,080
has remained quiet since the upheaval inflicted

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,660
upon the world's largest multinational conglomerate.

180
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,130
Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson

181
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,140
released a statment today stating that,

182
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,100
'these groups lack the resources and knowledge

183
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,410
of the U.S cell to successfully mount an attack.'"

184
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,850
End quote.

185
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,860
Yeah, so?

186
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,710
We gotta get the Dark Army back.

187
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,210
Dude, I've been trying.

188
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,380
How many times do you want me to hack him?

189
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,880
Do you know how hard hacking a hacker is?

190
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,020
Cisco switches oses, like, all the time.

191
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,050
Darlene, we need one meeting.

192
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,470
Yeah, well, I've been using Cisco's handle

193
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,040
to send requests for the past month.

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,780
I got nothing.

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,010
He's slower than me, but not by much.

196
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,010
If we can talk to WhiteRose directly--

197
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,770
WhiteRose? WhiteRose?

198
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,690
Really?

199
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,210
Okay, if--if the guy even exists,

200
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,930
and that's a big if, 

201
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,390
no way he's meeting you face-to-face.

202
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,060
For all we know...

203
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,430
This dude's WhiteRose.

204
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,570
Excuse me!

205
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,550
Are you WhiteRose?

206
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,770
A likely story.

207
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,660
'sides, the tape backups already shipped

208
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,730
to all the new Steel Mountain facilities,

209
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,390
and we still haven't found a way around that.

210
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,870
I got a plan in motion.

211
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,250
And god's laughing.

216
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,500
This is all I have left of her.

217
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,320
I will miss her.

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,680
I need to wipe again.

219
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
So if you scroll to the next page,

220
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,160
you'll see the summary of capital budgets

221
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,390
for purchasing and operations.

222
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,880
We get it. The goddamn earning reports

223
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,560
are gonna look good come monday.

224
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,530
Our aim is to facilitate bill payment

225
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,190
and heighten financial security,

226
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,090
so that's an extra 2%.

227
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,610
You know, if we hadn't turned our profits around,

228
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,780
- I was gonna leave. - No way.

229
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,040
Where? Don't tell me apple.

230
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,170
- Google. - Don't buy it.

231
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,130
I got a blow job from the hiring executive

232
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,380
on the Googleplex volleyball court.

233
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,410
Oh, she was hot.

236
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,420
Hot execs started as hot assistants

237
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,150
who fucked their way to the top

238
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,140
twice as fast as the rest of us.

239
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,860
You know something screwed up?

240
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,650
I heard that, some assistants, they're going gay

241
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,710
to move up the ladder.

242
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,770
I'll do you one better.

243
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,480
There's a special handful

244
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,780
of pathetically desperate execs going cock jockey.

245
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,020
No. Oh, my god!

246
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,150
Hey, Dwight, I meant to ask. How are your children?

247
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,540
Hell if I know. Sent 'em off to Lawrence.

248
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,260
I think Julia likes art.

249
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,440
Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.

250
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,060
Lawrence?

251
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,250
You'll never be able

252
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,350
to afford that tuition on unemployment.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,600
- Sorry? - You're fired!

254
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,290
You two as well.

255
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,020
I'm making sure you all receive the minimum severance packages.

256
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,240
Mr. Wellick, I-I don't understand.

257
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
What did we do?

258
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,830
Nothing.

259
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,770
- After-- - You said you would update me.

260
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,960
I needed to discuss our situation

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,390
with the state's attorney.

262
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,520
Thanks for coming in, Roy.

263
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,370
I think you should have a seat.

264
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,520
Colby's lawyers called 30 minutes ago.

265
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,230
They wanted a promise of total immunity before the meeting,

266
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,560
which I obtained from the man you just met.

267
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,830
So, yes, Colby agreed...

268
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,180
with a caveat.

269
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,440
I can't be in the room. You have to go in alone.

270
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,540
Look, you made a ballsy move...

271
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,780
But you doing what you're about to do--

272
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,720
entering the home of a very powerful man

273
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,410
with a lot at stake and asking him for something--

274
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,790
That's always a dangerous proposition.

275
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,840
So one last time...

276
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,870
Are you sure you want to do this?

277
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,550
Shit, man.

278
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,170
Thought you was one of them high schoolers

279
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,980
stole my mom's chaise lounge.

280
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,460
As heartbreaking as it is to hear that,

281
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,850
you're gonna have to put that off.

282
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,020
Getting everybody back together.

283
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,650
- Come on. - No, man, not this time.

284
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,790
I'm out.

285
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,110
You can't be out. We need you.

286
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,080
Look, man, I got a new set of people depending on me, okay?

287
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,620
Clients out the wazoo.

288
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,650
So, you know, I mean, good luck,

289
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,340
and tell the kids I said hi.

290
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,080
What is this? What are you doing here?

291
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,640
Well, I figured out how to insert

292
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,990
THC's genetic information code into yeast cells.

293
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,550
Tripled my earning speed.

294
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,880
Plants need weeks to develop. Microbes need days.

295
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,680
So, what, you got a bath and body works

296
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,900
bottling facility in your backyard?

297
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,120
Try it.

298
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,240
The THC level is borderline in that blend,

299
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,500
and the lavender doesn't mess with the high.

300
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,160
You just smooth it on your skin.

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,640
So you're rejecting a revolution in favor of aroma profiles?

302
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,050
What a waste of potential.

303
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,390
Look, man, I know I got a good brain.

304
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,320
Besides...

305
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,400
What was our little project in the end, anyway?

306
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,130
Wasted shit, if you ask me.

307
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Well, now you're borderline pissing me off.

308
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,090
Is that a fact?

309
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,380
And what exactly are you gonna do

310
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,470
if I decide to cross that border?

311
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,870
Look at my face, Romero.

312
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,480
You and I both know I'm crazy.

313
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,800
Not the cute kind either.

314
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,950
I'm talking crazy crazy!

315
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,530
You lost touch.

316
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,510
You forgot the feeling of spilling blood

317
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,360
on the battlefield by winning the fight.

318
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,460
I didn't want to hurt you, Romero.

319
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,430
I love you, man.

320
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,200
I just wanted you to come back to the arcade with me

321
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,100
so we could change the world together.

322
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,880
I am clearly too crazy for you to say no to.

323
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,400
Look on your face is priceless!

324
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,610
Goddamn lunatic.

325
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,940
You gave me your word when we started this thing

326
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,050
that you'd finish it.

327
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,390
I gave you my word what I'd do if you didn't.

328
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,990
See you back at the arcade.

329
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,520
Good. I see the girl got you tea.

330
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,360
Well, let's get started.

331
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,380
How much do you want?

332
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,840
Write your number.

333
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,460
You can ask me anything you want,

334
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,730
but I promise you, at the end of the day,

335
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,900
money will always be better than what you're looking for.

336
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,840
Mr. Colby, did you attend

337
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,100
the executive board meetings during 1993?

338
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,080
Were you in the room when the decision was made

339
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
to ignore the treatment of hazardous waste

340
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,710
in Washington Township?

341
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,050
I have information which can help you...

342
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,020
if you answer my question.

343
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

344
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,660
If you agree to testify against the executives

345
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,730
who covered up the illegal dumping of expoxy resin waste,

346
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,210
I will testify that I broke chain of custody

347
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,720
with the dat file central to your case.

348
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,320
You're that hot little thing

349
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,060
that came by here a month ago.

350
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,800
The girl from Allsafe.

351
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,030
I remember, yeah.

352
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,380
Okay...I'm gonna answer your question.

353
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,010
But here's what I need from you first.

354
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,220
So I'm gonna pull down my pants,

355
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,490
and then I'm gonna need you to take that pouty mouth of yours

356
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,390
and swallow up my balls.

357
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,270
Now, they're big and hairy, especially the left one,

358
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,510
so you're really gonna have to, I don't know,

359
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,280
squish 'em up to get 'em inside there.

360
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,330
You're probably gonna have to do one cheek at a time.

361
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,300
But then, once they're all warm and snug in there,

362
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,300
I want you to repeat your question to me

363
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,480
as clearly as you can.

364
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,720
Then, and only then, am I willing to answer.

365
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,300
What do you say?

366
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,810
If you don't take this deal...

367
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,510
you'll become like me.

368
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,760
Sure, maybe you'll live in this house...

369
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,880
Maybe you'll have money,

370
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,880
but even if your expensive lawyers find a way to get you off, 

371
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,450
people will still think that you're guilty.

372
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,130
Losing everyone's respect...

373
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,600
the respect of people you know and the people you don't...

374
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,890
It's a shitty feeling.

375
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,080
Trust me.

376
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,600
I'll have "the girl" let me out.

377
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,890
Flipper. Is she microchipped?

378
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,910
Okay, very good.

379
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,490
Housekeeping done.

380
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,210
Now onto the real business.

381
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,770
Has your dog ever eaten trash before?

382
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,960
No. I mean, not that I remember.

383
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,760
Well, lucky for your bank account,

384
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,430
The piece is small enough to pass on its own.

385
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,260
Unfortunately, though, it's large enough

386
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,360
to send her puking all over your apartment.

387
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,050
So I would crate her for a few days and monitor her.

388
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,720
She won't know what you're doing is good for her.

389
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,040
You were right. I was only trying to prove--

390
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,450
Colby's lawyers just called. He wants to talk.

391
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,000
Get back there.

392
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,630
It's a little early in the morning to be nerding out,

393
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,940
don't you think?

394
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,850
How long?

395
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,980
I knew if I asked you that--

396
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,050
How long?

397
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
Couple weeks.

398
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,690
And you had the balls to ask for WhiteRose with my shit?

399
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,100
It's like you want to get us both killed.

400
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,690
What happened? He responded?

401
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,920
You know,

402
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,890
you didn't have to make me look like a shitty foot soldier.

403
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,360
Nobody would ever even know--

404
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,570
You got root on my box and found the IP,

405
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,610
then you joined their channel with my handle.

406
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,840
We're so done.

407
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,650
I don't want to see you again.

408
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,700
But you fools actually got your wish.

409
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,330
I don't know why,

410
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,000
but the meeting's actually gonna be on.

411
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,890
I'd tell you to be careful,

412
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,630
but I know that's the last thing you're gonna be.

413
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,730
My lawyers are looking over the paperwork.

414
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,280
- Does that mean that-- - exactly what I said.

415
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,680
I asked you back here to make sure that you can pull off your testimony,

416
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,850
make sure that this chain of custody, story of yours is straight.

417
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,240
I can't afford any trips.

418
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,630
I'm not going to trip.

419
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,890
So, what--

420
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,420
What's in this for you, anyway?

421
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,450
I know you hate me.

422
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,250
So, what, you're gonna just let me off scot-free?

423
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,320
What do you get out of this?

424
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,580
Earlier, I asked you a question.

425
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,330
You never answered it.

426
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,150
If I'm agreeing to testify in your case, then,

427
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,250
yes, you know, I attended several meetings.

428
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,290
Tell me about the one when they decided to ignore the leak.

429
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,260
I'm--I'm not sure what you're asking.

430
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,150
What was the meeting like when you decided this?

431
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,880
I get it.

432
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,030
You want to know, like, what was it like?

433
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,310
Like, um, did we all have cigars and laugh hysterically

434
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,250
as we signed the evil documents?

435
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,820
Is that what you pictured?

436
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,480
Well, I'm sorry, hon.

437
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,500
See, the world doesn't work like that.

438
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,120
Tell me. Tell me how it works.

439
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,370
Uh, Jesus, um...All right, all right.

440
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,500
Let's see. January, '93.

441
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,720
Well, my secretary then was Elaine.

442
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,490
So Elaine brought us a platter of shrimp cocktail

443
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,930
to tide us to dinner, which pissed us off

444
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,990
because we just had a platter at the holiday party.

445
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,440
Jim opened the bar.

446
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,880
Now Jim was a real piece of work.

447
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,550
I mean, half pansy, half Mafia.

448
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,530
First sign of a tight decision, he'd be chain smoking

449
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,390
down a river of Scotch.

450
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,630
You know, it rained.

451
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,420
It rained. I remember that, yeah.

452
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,240
So...

453
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,330
You were drunk, eating shrimp cockail,

454
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,820
and it was raining when you decided my mother would die?

455
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,880
That's why.

456
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,830
So people like you won't keep sitting in rooms together.

457
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,380
Did any of it ever give you or anyone pause

458
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,650
when you made those decisions?

459
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,940
Yeah.

460
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,580
Yeah, sure.

461
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,810
But, um...

462
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,540
then you go home, and, uh, and you have dinner,

463
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,650
you know, and--and you wake up the next morning.

464
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,990
Here's to a man who has a bright future at our company,

465
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,360
a man you all know,

466
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,220
a man who is going to change this company for the good,

467
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,410
a man smart enough to marry a woman every bit his equal...

468
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,650
Our new Chief Technology Officer, Scott Knowles.

469
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,010
Here, here!

470
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,270
Thank you. Thank you.

471
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,840
- Thank you, Phillip. - Welcome.

472
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,010
- Thank you very much. - Here we go.

473
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,810
It's great to be here. And we're off.

474
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,540
- Thanks, Phillip. - You're very welcome.

475
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,170
- Congratulations, darling. - Thank you, thank you.

476
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,670
Hey, Joe, how are you?

478
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,000
Thank you.

479
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,140
Tyrell, nice to see you.

480
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,030
Is it?

481
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,650
I hear you shared our moment with your husband.

482
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,070
Oh, come on. That was over a month ago.

483
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,670
Don't tell me you're still sore.

484
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,280
Hmm, I sense some defeat.

485
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,290
Well, I considered myself, at the very least, reprimanded.

486
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,770
How disappointing.

487
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,050
One tiny curveball and you gave up.

488
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,500
Miss.

489
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,680
Thank you.

490
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,590
Should have known that you were nothing more than a bold entrance.

491
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,940
Are you saying you don't crave a bold entrance

492
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,500
every time, over and over, sustained?

493
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,380
Meet me tonight.

494
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,550
I'm a little busy.

495
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,530
Come to my office now.

496
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,150
Are you really asking me that?

497
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,420
I don't recall phrasing it as a question, no.

498
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,640
Fine, then I just won't show up.

499
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,650
Then the roof.

500
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,050
Take the back stairwell.

501
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,880
The cameras have been out since March.

502
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,300
No one will know.

503
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,970
Well, you just made a long day longer.

504
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,720
I know that Allsafe will have to fire me,

505
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,600
but testifying was the right thing to do.

506
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,200
I have worked my ass off to take care of you

507
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,080
and of every person in this company.

508
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,240
Do you know what that means?

509
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,300
You've been a great boss, Gideon--

510
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,330
See, once this confession goes public,

511
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,260
no one will want to do business with us.

512
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,920
The company will go under.

513
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,890
I couldn't let Colby take the fall

514
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,820
- for something that I did. - Oh, come on!

515
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,720
You and I both know you didn't break chain of custody.

516
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,790
I did and I feel terrible--

517
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,640
Angela! Please! Stop lying.

518
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,980
You do this... All these people go down,

519
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,180
all their families 

520
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,820
that rely on what this company provides for them.

521
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,140
So this is where the rabbit hole leads?

522
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,390
Got to be honest,

523
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,420
I half-expected you not to show up.

524
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,330
And I half-expected you to be a tattletale.

525
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,200
So you are sore.

526
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, come on. You intrigued me.

527
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,830
I intrigued back.

528
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,630
Can't we just be more straightforward?

529
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,610
Oh, that's no fun, but if you insist,

530
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,610
I just came up here to see if you were really

531
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,250
as gullible as you seem.

532
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,940
My husband's downstairs getting the job that you want,

533
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,980
and you're up here trying to fuck me.

534
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,710
Now whether that's you being straightforward or a game,

535
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,830
either way, it's played pretty poorly, if you ask me.

536
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Again, I asked no question.

537
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,420
All I can tell you is you need this

538
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,090
'cause you're dissatisfied.

539
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,360
Scott plans on firing you,

540
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,540
and you are clinging on to any chance you can get.

541
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,710
You seem desperate.

542
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,190
What do you-- get off of me!

543
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,010
Stop!

544
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,220
We connected with WhiteRose.

545
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,770
The plan is back on.

546
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,220
I could bullshit you, tell you you're the only person

547
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,370
who can fill the exact void we have at fsociety.

548
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,960
The truth is, I need this group back together.

549
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,320
Have you ever considered which part of our scheme motivates you?

550
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,870
When the Dark Army bailed, 

551
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,180
you didn't care if pushing a button 

552
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,110
would bring an economic revolution.

553
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,470
You want momentary anarchy.

554
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,820
The others?

555
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,140
Mobley likes palling around.

556
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,430
Romero wants a whiff of fame.

557
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,750
Those reasons depress me.

558
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,030
- What's the part you want? - You don't care.

559
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,650
My parents were born in Iran.

560
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,400
They came here like everybody else,

561
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,310
for freedom,

562
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,780
but my dad works 60-hour weeks

563
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,210
to determine tax loopholes for a millionaire art dealer.

564
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,660
My mom, she ran up loans into five digits

565
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,200
to get an online degree.

566
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,190
They won't shut up about how great America is.

567
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,200
But they're gonna die in debt 

568
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,360
doing things they never wanted to do.

569
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,020
There are how many billion people in this world?

570
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,430
7.3.

571
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,910
Somehow you and I landed together...

572
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,370
Doing something impossible if we were alone,

573
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,400
not to mention at the right point in history with the right resources.

574
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,540
We have what we've worked for right there for the taking.

575
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,900
We just need each other to see this through.

576
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,880
You come any closer, I'm calling the cops.

577
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,590
Hi, operator. I'd like to report an emergency.

578
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,500
I placed a malicious cd in my work computer,

579
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,050
and now this guy at the gym is saying hi to me.

580
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,150
I'm going home.

581
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,650
I need you to do something for me.

582
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,230
Call the girl who wants to be involved, okay?

583
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,590
Her name is Angela Moss.

584
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,360
Let me give you her phone number.

585
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,830
Listen, pussy. If you don't do what I say,

586
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,520
then the giant shit storm that rains turds later

587
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,110
will leave a trail of clouds in the sky spelling out your name.

588
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,870
Elliot? I wasn't expecting you.

589
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,680
I'm here for my appointment.

590
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,870
Well, you can slip in before my first patient.

591
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,170
You told me I should tell you the truth.

592
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,280
Yes.

593
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,310
Everything I say will still be protected and confidential?

594
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,800
I've been lying to you.

595
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,390
I don't take my pills.

596
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,630
But you don't either.

597
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,050
Your refill frequency for ativan doesn't match

598
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,130
your prescription divided by the dosage.

599
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
This morning...

600
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,470
You bought a tall hazelnut latte.

601
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,990
Paid for it on your evil corp card.

602
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,500
By text, you justified the indulgence to your sister

603
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,050
because evil corp gives you double rewards.

604
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,240
But those points only accumulate on travel expenses.

605
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,920
You're not good with money.

606
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,720
On paper, your Thursday 2:00, Marilyn O'Brien,

607
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,300
is your doppelganger.

608
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,820
I think you're encouraging her

609
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,150
to leave her husband...

610
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,050
Because you're tired of being dumped.

611
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,820
You like porn, especially anal.

612
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,080
Whether you like it yourself, I don't know.

613
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,010
That's not relevant to me.

614
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,730
You've told your best friend Jennifer

615
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,790
that you wish your mom would die.

616
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,960
I sometimes watch you on your webcam.

617
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,800
You cry sometimes...

618
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,620
Just like me.

619
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,510
Because you're lonely.

620
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,260
I don't just hack you, Krista.

621
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,570
I hack everyone--

622
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,020
My friends, coworkers.

623
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,430
But I've helped a lot of people.

624
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,260
I want...

625
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,710
A way out of loneliness...

626
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,640
Just like you.

627
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,140
Is that what you wanted to hear?
