1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,120
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,380
raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,320
This is what we're doing.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,540
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,780
You just gonna hit up the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,180
He has my bank account, Ollie.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,980
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,590
I'll lose my job.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,680
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,650
They are physically copying then shipping

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,280
all the analog backups.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,650
We go up today.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
I want you to be where you belong:

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,900
here with me.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,350
I think I'm happy where I am.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,420
Don't let me down, okay?

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,740
That girl in there is mine.

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,990
Did you have something to do with Vera getting busted?

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,830
He's on murder charges, do you know that?

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,590
It's my plan. I'll go in.

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,160
You might be able to hide it from these nerds,

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,200
but I know a junkie when I see one.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,490
I'm alone.

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,900
No, you're not.

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,550
I wish I had better news for you, Fernando,

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,860
but this isn't the you're-getting-out meeting.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,580
This is only as much as I could carry.

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,480
The D.A. has more.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,910
How long this gonna be?

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,930
We're talking years.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
Yo, you playing?

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,440
You get our people out.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,390
That's your use to us.

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,030
They have a solid case.

36
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,560
For every charge they're gonna lay on you,

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,700
they have these binders, your twitters, your instagram.

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,390
You said they wouldn't figure this shit out.

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,480
They can't, brah.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm telling you, it was airtight, V.

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,330
Fellas, this isn't the Imitation Game.

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,540
The code here is not that complicated.

43
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,080
Besides, who told you to put your business

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,120
anywhere near social media?

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,230
My aspirational little brother.

46
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,440
You know how much money we saved last year?

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,270
Made our whole operation way more efficient.

48
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,470
We were careful.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,870
You tweeted about every transaction

50
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,970
your business was involved in.

51
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,910
That is the opposite of careful.

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,170
It's no wonder an anonymous tip turned you in.

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,900
Who called in the tip?

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,960
This is what is meant by anonymous.

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,790
It is now spilled milk.

56
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,260
The information got out,

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,310
and now they're coming down hard.

58
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,520
There's no plea on the table.

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,250
They're gonna lay murder one on you.

60
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,630
I ain't pleading anyway.

61
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,010
Men can't sentence me.

62
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,310
That is a cosmic responsibility.

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

64
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,870
That's how we get square with the universe.

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,370
Fernando, we need to discuss strategy.

66
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,620
You don't want supermax.

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,810
Naw, naw.

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,100
If they lock me up,

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,250
the kind of door they close don't matter.

70
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
So that's you.

71
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,680
That's who you are.

72
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,090
I know you.

73
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,400
Excuse me.

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,120
Pardon me. Pardon me. I already paid.

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,590
Just want to pay my respects.

76
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,760
Thank you. Thank you.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,250
Ooh, I'm sorry, man. Sorry.

78
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,020
Just want to pay my compliments.

79
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,810
Hey, excellent coffee, fantastic service.

80
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,400
Buy yourself something nice.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,780
Steel Mountain.

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
We're trying to penetrate a data security facility

83
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,030
whose tagline literally is...

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,470
Nothing is actually impenetrable.

85
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,310
A place like this says it is, and it's close,

86
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,440
but people still built this place.

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,700
And if you can hack the right person,

88
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,300
all of a sudden,

89
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,430
you have a piece of powerful malware.

90
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,220
People always make the best exploits.

91
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,370
I've never found it hard to hack most people.

92
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,310
If you listen to them, watch them,

93
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,390
their vulnerabilities are like

94
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,080
a neon sign screwed into their heads.

95
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Mobley's a glutton.

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,640
He lacks discipline from his urges.

97
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,860
I don't want to get bugs. They spread disease.

98
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,640
Romero is a know-it-all and a hypochondriac.

99
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,780
Bill Harper is our first exploit.

100
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,260
He isn't gonna give the search much scrutiny.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,320
He'll get us to Level 1,

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,990
but Bill is not gonna be able to get us to Level 2.

103
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,930
And we need to get to Level 2.

104
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,650
You're gonna ask to speak to his supervisor, Wendy.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,630
She'll get us to exactly where we need to be.

106
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,000
Then we'll be able to get rid of her from the van.

107
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,080
After that, you connect the Raspberry Pi

108
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,870
to the climate control system, and Bob's your uncle.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,310
Now we can hear you, and you can hear us.

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
Mr. Robot?

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,150
His flaw is he's absolutely insane.

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,490
We're talking clinical.

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,110
When they say, "If your friends jump off a bridge, would you?"

114
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,970
He would, without hesitation,

115
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,220
just to prove something.

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,780
He goes in there, he's liable to blow the whole place up,

117
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,640
just like he wanted to in the first place.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,910
Sure you don't want to look over the info and the map again?

119
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,930
I got it.

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,340
Okay, James Bond, let's go mess their shit up.

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,330
Yes, I also have security flaws.

122
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,210
I don't like being outside.

123
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,620
I liked morphine too much.

124
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,700
Mr. Sepiol?

125
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm talking to you right now,

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,380
and you don't exist.

127
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,980
Sam Sepiol?

128
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,710
Sir?

129
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,170
That's you, Elliot.

130
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,470
Okay.

131
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,540
So sorry you had to wait.

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,300
As you can see, there's always a lot of bustle here.

133
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,500
How can I help you today?

134
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,990
you need a tour. Don't elaborate.

135
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,270
A tour.

136
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,430
Okay.

137
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,890
I'm sure they told you at reception

138
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,520
that we--we require appointments for tours.

139
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,580
My supervisor gives us all a hard time about that.

140
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,770
I'm Sam Sepiol.

141
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,700
You should look me up.

142
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,900
Okay.

143
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,300
A little inelegant, but we can work with it.

144
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,920
Tell you what.

145
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,740
Have your company call over to new accounts,

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,140
and we can set something up later this week.

147
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,540
Ask for Bill Harper.

148
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,810
They'll know where to find me.

149
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,840
listen, Bill.

150
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,730
You think your boss gives you a hard time now?

151
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,220
You're gonna get a really hard time

152
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,760
right after I walk out of here.

153
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm not rescheduling, Bill.

154
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,450
When I walk out that door, I'm never coming back.

155
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,080
That's your ass, Bill.

156
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,780
I really think you should look me up.

157
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,230
It--it just doesn't work like that.

158
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,710
You take care, okay?

160
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm coming out. It's not working.

161
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,120
It's gonna work.

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,090
Hang in there.

163
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,660
I was being too weird.

164
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,620
Just like every other tech billionaire.

165
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,730
Slow your roll. It's gonna happen.

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,170
It's no wonder Wikipedia is never accurate.

167
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,710
Anyone can edit them.

168
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,950
Well, not anyone.

169
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,520
Nerds like Mobley built a lot of credit over the years

170
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,490
with his 20,000 edits.

171
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,570
And still people trust it,

172
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,890
beholden to all the Mobleys of the world for their information.

173
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,060
Mr. Sepiol?

174
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,560
Mr. Sepiol!

175
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,420
I have some good news.

176
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,410
Stop it. Stop it.

177
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,390
Can you stop packing for, like, five minutes?

178
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,020
Can we just hash this out like adults?

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,210
I love you.

180
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,260
You don't even know why you're crying.

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,500
Let's get married.

182
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,280
Ollie, will you please stop?

183
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,010
Angela--Angela, you can't just give up on us like this.

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,210
I mean, have you even thought this through?

185
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,620
What are you gonna do, go live with your dad in Jersey?

186
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,750
Come on.

187
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,900
You're ruining your life.

188
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,170
Maybe,

189
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,220
but I also ruined yours.

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Why do you have my work ID?

191
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,730
Did you--

192
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,130
Did you-- do you--do you--

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,870
Do you know what's gonna happen?

194
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,510
There will be fallout from this, and I'm gonna tell them--

195
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,480
I used your computer, so tell them whatever you want.

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,940
Are you serious?

197
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,850
Did you even think about how this would affect me?

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,420
I did.

199
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,610
Here's an idea of how big this place is.

200
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,450
We have our own fire department, inside the building,

201
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,860
Just for us.

202
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,600
And you can't have a fire department without a fire truck,

203
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,050
and you can't have a fire truck without roads.

204
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,810
We have all of that, inside.

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,370
Imagine that.

206
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,590
Elliot, now's the time we get rid of bill.

207
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,330
There's so much information...

208
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,730
Okay, we're gonna need to roll up our sleeves here.

209
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,220
You have to destroy Bill in order to get to a supervisor.

210
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,680
There's one vault in here that's 200,000 square feet.

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,290
That's the size of a shopping mall,

212
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,590
and that's just one.

213
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,440
Bill, where are those giant vaults?

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, they're on level 2, but that's not part of the tour.

215
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,470
Even I don't have authorization.

216
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,170
He's not gonna take you for ice cream.

217
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,670
He has to go away.

218
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,770
There's no place in this plan for Bill.

219
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,110
Now, right down here--

220
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,210
Everything okay, sir?

221
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,170
We need to tear Bill down piece by piece.

222
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,430
You need to wipe that smile off of his stupid face.

223
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,850
Sir, are you okay?

224
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,540
You're not-- you're not saying anything.

225
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,350
Dig into him, Elliot.

226
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,200
You of all people can do this, Elliot.

227
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,920
You know how it feels when someone makes you small.

228
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,540
You understand what happens when someone exposes

229
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,660
the thing you fear most about yourself.

230
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,680
Answer me!

231
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,850
Answer me!

232
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,320
Get up.

233
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,020
Just get up!

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,720
I hate you.

235
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,900
You're nothing.

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,270
You're worthless.

237
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,310
Think about it, Bill.

238
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,520
Think about what?

239
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,470
If you died,

240
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,200
would anyone care?

241
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,880
Would they really care?

242
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,230
Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day,

243
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,210
but let's be honest.

244
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,710
No one would give a shit.

245
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,370
They wouldn't.

246
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,110
The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral

247
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,140
would probably be annoyed,

248
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,950
and leave as early as possible.

249
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,490
That's who you are.

250
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,140
That's what you are.

251
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,600
You're nothing to anyone,

252
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,300
to everyone.

253
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,190
Think about it, Bill.

254
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,600
'cause if you do,

255
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,980
if you let yourself...

256
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,600
You'll know I'm telling you the truth.

257
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,220
So instead of wasting any more of my time,

258
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,730
I need you to go call someone that matters,

259
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,240
because, Bill...

260
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,250
You don't.

261
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,610
I'll...

262
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,510
I'll call my supervisor.

263
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,450
And that's why Bill Harper is a perfect exploit,

264
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,950
desperate enough for the business to break protocol

265
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,050
and let me in.

266
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,740
Lonely enough to break.

267
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,940
I need a supervisor in L1-S3.

268
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,420
Copy that.

269
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,200
Don't apologize.

270
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,110
You're almost there. You did great.

271
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,970
Once Wendy gets there, we'll send her a text

272
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,180
letting her know her pregnant wife is in labor.

273
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,440
Once she leaves, that should give you enough time

274
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,150
to plant the Pi, you dig?

275
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,760
Trudy Davis, Accounts Supervisor.

276
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,020
Is there a problem here?

277
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,700
- Mr. Sepiol is asking... - Trudy?

278
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,250
for someone more senior than me.

279
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,800
I don't seem to have your name.

280
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,070
I'm Sam Sepiol?

281
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,790
- Is that a question? - Trudy? Trudy?

282
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,820
Where's Wendy?

283
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,710
We only prepped for Wendy. Where the hell is Wendy?

284
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,840
I need Wendy, actually.

285
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,490
And how do you know Wendy? She didn't come in today.

286
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,550
What is it that you need, Mr. Sepiol?

287
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,470
I would love a tour of Level 2.

288
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,910
I don't know what you've been told,

289
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,680
but we don't allow that.

290
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,090
I'll see you out. You can go, Bill.

291
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,500
Follow me to the lobby.

292
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,420
This woman's a ghost.

293
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,310
None of these are her.

294
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,950
No Facebook, no LinkedIn.

295
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,640
She's been married for 30 years.

296
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,060
All we have is her husband's cell phone number.

297
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,160
He doesn't even have a picture online.

298
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,790
No hobbies, no kids,

299
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,770
no credit problems, no weird sex stuff.

300
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,120
House paid off.

301
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,080
I need-- I need to-- I need to think.

302
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,240
The elevator's almost here.

303
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,270
Yes, that's how they work when you press the button.

304
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,560
Okay.

305
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,920
People-- people are all just people, right?

306
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,740
When it gets down to it, everyone's the same.

307
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,560
They love something.

308
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,010
They want something. They fear something.

309
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,420
Specifics help, but specifics don't change

310
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,860
the way that everyone is vulnerable.

311
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,510
It just changes the way that we access those vulnerabilities.

312
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,420
I-I have to go. I'm sorry.

313
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,920
I need to go to my office.

314
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,610
Reception will see you out.

315
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,650
What'd you do?

316
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,480
I spoofed a text from her husband.

317
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,000
It's a palm print scanner.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
Get out of there.

319
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,910
There's one door manually locked.

320
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,270
It's a fire code thing, and I think you can pick it.

321
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,060
Where?

322
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,140
It's at the end of the hallway

323
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,920
if you're heading north on L1.

324
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,650
The stairs don't go to Level 2.

325
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,210
They go to a parking lot.

326
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,620
You're on the complete wrong side of the building.

327
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,980
You're gonna have to double back

328
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,490
and go through the door you came in and make a run for it.

329
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,710
Elliot...

330
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,540
I thought I saw you.

331
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,990
What are you doing here?

332
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,550
Thank you.

333
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,760
Y'all come back to Wingstravaganza.

334
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,220
Okay, real important...

335
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,640
Wingstravaganza means wings and extravaganza.

336
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,090
Do you know what extravaganza means?

337
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,430
Yep, it's a big deal.

338
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,990
You got it.

339
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,260
You look nervous. Are you excited?

340
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,040
- Oh, yeah. - Okay.

341
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,480
So you'll shadow me for the week, but don't sweat it.

342
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,160
It's like every other server job.

343
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,300
Well, I've actually never been a waitress before.

344
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,220
This is kind of like a new beginning for me.

345
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,010
What were you doing before?

346
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,310
Pharmaceutical sales.

347
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,410
Fancy.

348
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,310
You must have made bank. What happened?

349
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,910
Oh, um, just, you know, Obamacare.

350
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,100
Welcome to Steel Mountain's data center.

351
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,040
Our facility meets diamond specifications

352
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,330
and features a tier 10 certified build and design,

353
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,560
providing you with a safe, rock-solid fortress

354
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,390
for your data needs.

355
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,150
All of our facilities implement

356
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,670
comprehensive security measures...

357
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,040
they say I'm overdoing it, and I say exactly.

358
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,160
So yeah.

359
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,370
Elliot.

360
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,670
- Nice meeting you. - You too.

361
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,160
- Tell your wife I said hi. - I will.

362
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,520
Those men I just shook hands with,

363
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,220
financiers of Hezbollah and ISIS.

364
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,960
I wouldn't stare.

365
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,820
Did he know I was gonna be here?

366
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,550
Does he know why I'm here?

367
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,660
Shit, he's gonna kill me.

368
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,280
As you were saying?

369
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,040
Uh, just a routine data process check.

370
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,200
Allsafe does them all the time.

371
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,500
But why would they send you?

372
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,520
That type of thing isn't usually handled

373
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,140
by the engineers, is it?

374
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,720
We've been overlapping a lot in our duties.

375
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,740
Budget reasons.

376
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,400
It seems we both had the idea to work off-site today.

377
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,040
Let's call this fortuitous.

378
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,760
Join me for lunch?

379
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,840
S-sure.

380
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,870
I eat lunch.

381
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,660
So you are like the rest of us.

382
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,160
Come.

383
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,630
He got owned, man.

384
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,800
We got to go.

385
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,690
We're not going anywhere.

386
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
This changes nothing.

387
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,750
What can I get you, Elliot?

388
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,530
Have a lot of things here.

389
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,810
He has a vulnerability.

390
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,340
He's an arrogant prick, and he's proud of it.

391
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,390
He cares what you think about him,

392
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,140
even though he probably hates that he does.

393
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,990
Tyrell Wellick's greatest asset is his hubris,

394
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,530
but it's also his flaw, and that's your exploit.

395
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,780
Would be nice.

396
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,790
You eat here?

397
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,760
This place?

398
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,640
Is that your plan, to piss him off?

399
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,100
No, wait, man. Wait.

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,660
Now remember, Elliot,

401
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,770
you'll lose our signal on level 2.

402
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,160
Elliot.

403
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,990
Elliot, say something if you can hear us.

404
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,230
I'm impressed you came all the way out here.

405
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,820
Allsafe is finished, but you won't let it die.

406
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,860
We're the same.

407
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,950
We're perfectionists.

408
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,010
I've seen our waiter here for the last... seven years.

409
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,310
Must be in his 50s, maybe has kids,

410
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,940
divorced, second wife, more kids.

411
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,250
And I wonder,

412
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,720
what must he think of himself?

413
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,630
His life's potential reached at a 30-grand-a-year salary,

414
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,160
an economy car he still owes money on,

415
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,390
two-bedroom apartment,

416
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,340
child support, coupons.

417
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,270
I couldn't bear it,

418
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,700
a life like that.

419
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,900
The life of an ordinary cockroach

420
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,020
whose biggest value is to serve me salad.

421
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,990
I have to go to the bathroom.

422
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,070
Goddamn withdrawals again.

423
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,680
Or is it Tyrell Wellick?

424
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,300
Is he toying with me?

425
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,800
What kind of game are we playing?

426
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,200
Am I his malware?

427
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,960
I had to wash my face.

428
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,100
Hard to breathe...

429
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:54,980
here.

430
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,720
I know you framed terry colby.

431
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,380
I-I didn't.

432
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,620
Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died.

433
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,470
That's a matter of public record.

434
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.

435
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,240
I don't even have proof,

436
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,190
and even if I did, I don't care.

437
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,210
Just wanted to know your weakness.

438
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,760
Now I do.

439
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,700
Revenge.

440
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,480
How ordinary.

441
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,250
Just like our waiter.

442
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,360
But even extraordinary people,

443
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,150
and I believe you are,

444
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,950
are driven by human banalities.

445
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,590
And unfortunately, we're all human.

446
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,830
Except me, of course.

447
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,950
I'm joking, Elliot.

448
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,870
Enjoy your long drive back home.

449
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm having a helicopter take me back to new york.

450
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,880
You take care, Elliot.

451
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,120
No. Bullshit.

452
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,830
Dude, bullshit!

453
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,280
- What did they say? - Oh, I don't know.

454
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,590
Basically that they're a bunch of dickless assholes.

455
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,290
- Where are you going? - To fix it.

456
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,030
No one else is going to.

457
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,860
Darlene, wait.

458
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,360
I really don't think you should keep pushing them.

459
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,290
Put it this way.

460
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,550
Either I'm fixing this or breaking it.

461
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,260
Their call.

462
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,750
Hi, pumpkin.

463
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,220
Hey, daddy.

464
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,610
Why aren't you at work?

465
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,690
I broke up with Ollie.

466
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
I know.

467
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,970
Just got off the phone with him.

468
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,710
Come on.

469
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,220
He was sobbing.

470
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,930
He wanted me to tell you something like,

471
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,640
"I'll always love you.

472
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,010
Please come back."

473
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,170
Oh, and he can learn to forgive you.

474
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
Jesus.

475
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,030
What did you say?

476
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,690
I told him I thought you should've broken up with him a long time ago

477
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,650
and hung up on him.

478
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,790
Nice.

479
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,750
What did he mean, anyway?

480
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,050
Just normal work and...

481
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,960
money stuff.

482
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,850
And, well, he cheated on me,

483
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,280
so there's that.

484
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,510
Well, the cheating part, I'm not surprised.

485
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,440
Not trying to make you feel bad, honey, but come on.

486
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,840
The kid's a douchebag.

487
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,640
- As for the money... - Dad, no.

488
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,760
I'll float you some money for professional development.

489
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,350
Dad--

490
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,610
Call it a loan,

491
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,250
but do not pay me back.

492
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,940
And you'll stay here and commute

493
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,570
until you can save for an apartment.

494
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,500
I can't make you do any of that.

495
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,500
And you didn't.

496
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,380
It's what I want.

497
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,740
Are you hungry?

498
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
- Yeah. - No, no. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

499
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,450
Relax.

500
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,000
What would you like?

501
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,410
You don't need to cook for me, dad.

502
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,420
French toast coming up!

503
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,070
Why are they backing out?

504
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,290
This is a library.

505
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,720
You want to discuss that, go back to the irc island.

506
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,700
They banned me from the channel!

507
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
What happened?

508
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,860
We just owned Steel Mountain.

509
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,470
We did our part, and it went perfect.

510
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,960
Come on, we both know that shit didn't go perfect.

511
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,230
Well, it doesn't matter! They called it off.

512
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,560
We pulled our side together,

513
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,960
and your side called it off like it was nothing.

514
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,240
You got your answer.

515
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,350
You better tell your pal WhiteRose to stop being a pussy

516
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,850
and start growing a pair

517
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,300
because we don't have time to dilly-dally around--

518
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,630
And now you're gonna talk about this in the world?

519
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,520
Do you even care who hears you?

520
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,400
Face it, Darlene.

521
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,400
It's over.

522
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,070
Walk away.

523
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,550
I can't go back to my people with that.

524
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,410
Tell me why.

525
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,530
You said the Dark Army was with us on this.

526
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,640
Between us?

527
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,010
I'm not about to goddamn tweet about it.

528
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,320
They were out before you ever got to Steel Mountain.

529
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,320
I don't know why. That's all they said to me.

530
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,380
I know you had your heart set,

531
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,890
but for real this time,

532
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,450
just let it go.

533
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,190
- I need seats mostly. - No.

534
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,610
I imagine it must be exciting to work in government.

535
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,030
It's like a spy movie.

536
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,980
Can you read my secret emails?

537
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,460
Mm, no.

538
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,950
My job is mostly paperwork and bureaucracy.

539
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,330
They always want more than the technology allows.

540
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,830
I don't even have time to read your secret emails.

541
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,960
But it's a stopgap for me.

542
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm restless.

543
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,520
I'm always itching for something else.

544
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,010
There have been a lot of something elses.

545
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,800
For both of us.

546
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,460
Before this, I worked at an ngo,

547
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,820
and before that, I worked at Microsoft for a year,

548
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,680
which felt like a decade.

549
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,670
Your place is beautiful.

550
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,400
I wish I could take the compliment.

551
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,420
The decorating is Scott's domain.

552
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,670
- Oh, really? - Yes.

553
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,210
- Very nice. - Yeah.

554
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,730
Where's all the-- the antiques from?

555
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,860
They're--

556
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,340
So they tapped you for CTO, yes?

557
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,820
Don't be surprised.

558
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,470
Suspicious is more accurate.

559
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,220
I was beginning to wonder why you set this dinner.

560
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,890
Four people in the world

561
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,690
know about my conversations.

562
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,730
Somehow you're number five.

563
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,550
Then I'm exactly what you need in a right hand.

564
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,920
So that's what this is about.

565
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,500
Isn't everything about something?

566
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,470
Like, we were thinking about, is it--is it babyproof?

567
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,100
Ah, yeah, that's-- that's a consideration.

568
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,840
If you were me,

569
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,900
would you trust you as your right hand?

570
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,180
If I were you,

571
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,560
I wouldn't have even let me in the house.

572
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,510
Hey, it's me.

573
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,680
Is now a good time?

574
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah.

575
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,470
I'm at my new job.

576
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
How's it going?

577
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,690
Seriously, it's hard as hell,

578
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,600
but I am getting the hang of it.

579
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,350
At first, it took me, like, years to marry ketchups,

580
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,250
but it turns out I'm amazing at upselling expensive cocktails.

581
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,460
I'm not surprised.

582
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,790
And then when I have to put together to-go orders,

583
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,540
it's like bagging molly, so I'm, like, kind of an expert.

584
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,550
How are you?

585
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,350
I'm good.

586
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,190
Wow, I've never heard you say a sentence like that before, ever.

587
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,400
I did what I had to do today.

588
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,160
Well, if you're around tonight,

589
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,460
come over and tell me about it, okay?

590
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,160
I got to go.

591
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,760
Okay, bye.

592
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,310
You seem to know how to drink your wine.

593
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,540
I indulge in few things, but I do love wine.

594
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,240
Yourself?

595
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,450
In my other life, when I could drink for one.

596
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,110
But even then I had cheap tastes.

597
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,050
It's safe to smell, though.

598
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,560
Put your nose in there.

599
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,900
You know, to me, it smells like every wine.

600
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,350
But I'd love to learn.

601
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,300
Dried red fruit, fresh violet,

602
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,790
uh, lemon peel.

603
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,020
Try it again.

604
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,520
Smell and really-- really think about it.

605
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,450
Mmm, I do smell lemon.

606
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,470
- Sharon? - Yeah?

607
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,540
How do you not blow your brains out being married to him?

608
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,490
Smell again.

609
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,770
Excuse me?

610
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,370
Shall I repeat the question?

611
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,480
You're a guest in our house.

612
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,520
A very honest one.

613
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,720
I think I'll mistake what you said as a joke in poor taste

614
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,730
and excuse myself to the bathroom.

615
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,510
I have a beautiful vintage over here.

616
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,490
I would love to just show you the label.

617
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,250
Let's see here.

618
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,140
Nope.

619
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,470
Nope.

620
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,740
There's the one.

621
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,930
This is my prized possession, actually.

622
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,960
Take a look at this.

623
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,290
I'm in here.

624
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,910
Can I help you?

625
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,110
Thank you for a lovely evening.

626
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,740
Siege in stormstout!

627
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,860
Carcass emblem!

628
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,980
We got problems.

629
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,410
Is the pi online?

630
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,110
Yeah, we're in the whole system.

631
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,310
We could deliver the whole payload right now if we wanted.

632
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,300
And yet I hear no applause.

633
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,490
Applaud.

634
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,250
You have to tell them.

635
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,230
What?

636
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,330
We lost China.

637
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,160
I'm sorry?

638
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,930
The Dark Army is bailing.

639
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,940
Why?

640
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,720
They don't answer whys apparently.

641
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,810
That's no problem. We'll just call 'em back.

642
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,460
We'll set up another meet asap--

643
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,710
Dude, did you not hear me?

644
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,090
They've gone dark. It's not happening.

645
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,590
I know. I know.

646
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,700
I get it, okay? I f---ed up.

647
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,570
Let's not wait, then.

648
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,330
Let's do it anyway, just us.

649
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,840
Let's do it right now.

650
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,070
Okay? We execute now.

651
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,850
We execute on our side and trust that the Dark Army

652
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,570
gets their shit together and follows.

653
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,040
Why do they get to dictate terms?

654
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,350
We dictate terms!

655
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,130
We can go now.

656
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,630
If we move forward and they don't,

657
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,820
China still holds all the redundant information.

658
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,850
It will be pointless.

659
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,580
And if we wait, it'll also be pointless.

660
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,350
Everything you guys did today would be for nothing.

661
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,540
God, are you crazy?

662
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,600
It will have no effect!

663
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,640
It'll take down their network for weeks.

664
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,620
They'll recover.

665
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,680
It would still hurt them.

666
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,150
We don't want to hurt them!

667
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,110
We want to kill them!

668
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,990
And neither will happen if we do nothing right now.

669
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,880
What are you doing, huh?

670
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,050
Take another step, and I'll do it.

671
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,280
Think about what you're doing, okay?

672
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,380
All right?

673
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
In a month, they're gonna be up and running again

674
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,200
with even better security.

675
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,160
We are not gonna get another shot at this.

676
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,120
The revolution that we've always talked about

677
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,810
will be gone, dead, and buried.

678
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,160
We will have failed because of you.

679
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,530
Please do not do this.

680
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,320
Is there anyone here who can communicate with this woman?

681
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,660
Please.

682
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,800
Tell me it's okay to execute.

683
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,120
But we were so close.

684
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,940
It's not over.

685
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,230
We'll rework it.

686
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,520
We'll figure something out.

687
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,570
We got this far.

688
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,250
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

689
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,850
This is all my fault.

690
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,610
Come on.

691
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,850
You can crash at my place.

692
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,540
My father picked me up from school one day,

693
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,710
and we played hooky and went to the beach.

694
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,450
It was too cold to go in the water,

695
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,890
so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza.

696
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,080
When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand,

697
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,360
and I dumped it on my bedroom floor.

698
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,490
I didn't know the difference.

699
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,490
I was six.

700
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,300
My mother screamed at me for the mess,

701
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,750
But he wasn't mad.

702
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,850
He said that billions of years ago,

703
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,040
the world shifting and the oceans moving

704
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,420
brought that sand to that spot on the beach,

705
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,900
and then I took it away.

706
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,600
"Every day," He said,

707
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,150
"We change the world," which is a nice thought

708
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,710
until I think about how many days and lifetimes

709
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,990
I would need to bring a shoe full of sand home

710
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,880
until there is no beach,

711
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,390
until it made a difference to anyone.

712
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,090
Every day, we change the world,

713
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,980
but to change the world in a way that means anything,

714
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,430
that takes more time than most people have.

715
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,540
It never happens all at once.

716
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,180
It's slow.

717
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,650
It's methodical.

718
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,110
It's exhausting.

719
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,230
We don't all have the stomach for it.

720
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,100
Hey, sweetie.

721
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,440
I'm gonna go for a run.

722
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,180
Nice.

723
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,600
Shayla's got the dog.

724
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,860
She doesn't shit on her pillows.

725
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,580
That's a plus, I guess.

726
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,450
Shayla?

727
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,440
Hey, brah.

728
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,440
Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly.

729
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,490
Here I am, locked away.

730
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,430
Still, it brings you right to me.
