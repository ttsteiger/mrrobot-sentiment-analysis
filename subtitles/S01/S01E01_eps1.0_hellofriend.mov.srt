1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:02,489
Hello, friend.

2
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,621
"Hello, friend."
That's lame.

3
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:08,894
Maybe I should give you a name,
but that's a slippery slope.

4
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:12,135
You're only in my head.
We have to remember that.

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,405
Shit.
It's actually happened,

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:18,146
I'm talking to
an imaginary person.

7
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,984
What I'm about to tell you
is top secret,

8
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:24,324
a conspiracy
bigger than all of us.

9
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,328
There's a powerful group
of people out there

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,002
that are secretly running
the world.

11
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,006
I'm talking about the guys
no one knows about,

12
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,945
the guys that are invisible.

13
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:37,048
The top 1% of the top 1%,

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,193
the guys that play God
without permission.

15
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:44,330
And now I think
they're following me.

16
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:55,084
This is about last night.

17
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,090
I should've gone
to Angela's birthday party.

18
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,161
Instead, I went to--

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,878
Hey, Ron.

20
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,324
There you go.

21
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,130
You're Ron.

22
00:01:57,307 --> 00:02:00,980
But your real name
is Rohit Mehta.

23
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,483
You changed it to Ron
when you bought

24
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,956
your first Ron's Coffee Shop
six years ago.

25
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:10,030
Now you got 17 of 'em
with 8 more coming next quarter.

26
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,573
May I help you
with something?

27
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,679
I like coming here
'cause your Wi-Fi was fast.

28
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,315
I mean, you're one
of the few spots

29
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,687
that has a fiber connection
with gigabit speed.

30
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,160
It's good.
So good, it scratched

31
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:29,702
that part of my mind, part
that doesn't allow good to exist

32
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,641
without condition,
so I started intercepting

33
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:35,146
all the traffic
on your network.

34
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:38,319
That's when I noticed
something strange.

35
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:41,993
It's when I decided
to hack you.

36
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,429
- Hack--
- I know you run a website

37
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,068
- called Plato's Boys.
- Pardon me?

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,707
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

39
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,411
You made it really hard
for anyone to see it,

40
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,450
but I saw it.
The onion routing protocol,

41
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,089
it's not as anonymous
as you think it is.

42
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,059
Whoever's in control
of the exit nodes

43
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:01,063
is also in control
of the traffic,

44
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:05,171
which makes me...
the one in control.

45
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,746
I must ask you to kindly leave.

46
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:10,281
I own everything.

47
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:13,221
All your emails.
All your files.

48
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,124
All your...pics.

49
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,036
Get out of here right now,
or I'll call the--

50
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:23,240
Police? You want them
to find out

51
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,244
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

52
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,383
you serve to
your 400,000 users?

53
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:32,158
Personally, man, I was
hoping it was just gonna be

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,197
some BDSM stuff.

55
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,502
You realize how much simpler
that would have been?

56
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:45,216
I did not hurt anyone.

57
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,554
I never did.

58
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,670
That's my...
personal life.

59
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:02,850
I understand what it's like

60
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:06,190
to be different.

61
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:10,665
I'm very different too.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,642
I mean, I don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

63
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:18,815
I don't know how
to talk to people.

64
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:22,456
My dad was the only one
I could talk to.

65
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:27,165
But he died.

66
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,913
I'm sorry to hear that.

67
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,351
How did he pass,
may I ask?

68
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:40,357
Leukemia.

69
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,662
He definitely got it
from radiation

70
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,666
at the company
he worked at,

71
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,437
though I couldn't
prove it.

72
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,276
Now he's dead.

73
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:52,781
Company's fine, though.

74
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,924
Oh...hey.

75
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,665
It's okay, Rohit.

76
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:06,375
You don't have to
worry anymore.

77
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:08,545
I don't understand.

78
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,753
Are you blackmailing me?

79
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:15,024
So that's what
this is about...

80
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,363
money.

81
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:21,604
That's all you care
about, huh?

82
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:23,275
No.

83
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,485
If I pay you now,
you'll want more and more.

84
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,392
No matter how much
I give.

85
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:34,896
You will inform
the police anyway.

86
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,967
I won't pay you, sir.

87
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,309
Remember,
you also broke the law.

88
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:45,451
Actually, you're right.

89
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,787
Partly.

90
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,659
See, I usually do
this kind of thing

91
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,928
from my computer,

92
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,666
but this time I wanted
to do it AFK.

93
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:54,935
In person.

94
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,409
Trying to work on
my social anxiety.

95
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:00,613
But there's always
the threat of you fleeing

96
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,949
after I call you out.

97
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,786
You'd tell your sys admin

98
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,525
to take your servers down,
wipe all the data.

99
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,896
So I made sure to include

100
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,834
the current time
and--and location

101
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:13,038
on my anonymous tip.

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,808
Wait. Hold on.
I'll give you the money.

103
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,644
I'll pay you.
How much do you want?

104
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,381
I'll pay you.

105
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:21,420
That's the part you were
wrong about, Rohit.

106
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,994
I don't give a shit
about money.

107
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,188
Now I'm being followed.

108
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,504
The higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

109
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,110
In three short minutes,
I destroyed a man's business,

110
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:51,914
life, existence.

111
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,185
- I deleted him.
- Hey!

112
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:58,460
Hey, you.
Hey, kiddo.

113
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,530
What's happening?

114
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,746
Exciting time
in the world right now.

115
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:11,686
Exciting time.

116
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,866
But I'm only a vigilante
hacker by night.

117
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:38,805
By day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

118
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:43,114
employee number ER28-0652.

119
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,921
Elliot!

120
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:49,125
In here.

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,302
- What's up?
- El.

122
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,255
Yeah, I can totally--
I can totally handle it.

123
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:06,693
They were hacked again.
Last night.

124
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,098
Gideon...

125
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,333
That's my childhood friend Angela.

126
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,970
She can be a bit
high strung sometimes,

127
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,007
but trust me--
she's one of the good ones.

128
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,943
What am I looking at?

129
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,082
Is this the log file?
This was a RUDY attack.

130
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,751
This is awesome.

131
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,355
- Gideon, will you answer me?
- Awesome?

132
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,359
You think this is awesome?
This is killing us, Elliot.

133
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,696
- Gideon, I'm not--
- Angela!

134
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:28,736
Let's just see how
this meeting goes today.

135
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:30,873
Their networks are getting
attacked every week.

136
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,978
Who knows if they'll still
even be a client.

137
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,415
They're coming in?

138
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,688
Hey, what did we say
about the dress code?

139
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,929
All right, now,
look over those logs.

140
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,869
And be ready this afternoon
in case they have any questions.

141
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,038
Okay?

142
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,941
Okay.

143
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,816
- Start smoking again?
- Did you not get

144
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,386
my texts last night?

145
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:56,256
I sent you exactly
13 of them.

146
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:58,293
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it.

147
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,137
You promised me that you were
gonna try this time.

148
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:22,737
Stop thinking about something else
when I'm talking to you.

149
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,411
I hate when you do that.

150
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:27,250
Sorry. I was thinking
about work.

151
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,521
Maybe that's why Gideon
loves you so much.

152
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,025
He thanks me all the time
for bringing you in.

153
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,295
But for some reason,

154
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,232
I think you secretly
hate it here.

155
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:38,037
She was right.
I liked most of the people,

156
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,141
but our business,
a cyber security firm

157
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:41,911
that protects corporations--

158
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,182
I can't think of anything
I hate more.

159
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,852
No, I love it here.

160
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,202
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:56,541
I'm just in a bad mood.

162
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,480
I'm late on my last
two student loan payments,

163
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,551
and I can't get Gideon
to give me a raise.

164
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,356
- Hey...
- Hi.

165
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,593
Yo, buddy.

166
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,597
Missed you last night.
Where were you?

167
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,135
Gotta go.
Big meeting today.

168
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,045
Did you find out
what happened?

169
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,582
Yeah. He said
he was working.

170
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,218
Oh, come on.
You gotta talk to him.

171
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,621
We're gonna be late
for the staff meeting.

172
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:23,961
He can't stand me.
And you know why.

173
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:26,364
Angela, I can't have
that kind of negativity

174
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,235
in my life.

175
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,441
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

176
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,933
What are you thinking about?

177
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,072
Nothing.

178
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,981
You want to know
what I'm thinking about?

179
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,252
First time
you came to me.

180
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,456
I didn't exactly
come to Krista.

181
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,560
I was forced here.
But I do like her.

182
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,398
Hacking her was simple.

183
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,003
Her password: Dylan 2791.

184
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:06,310
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

185
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:07,713
Though she's a psychologist,

186
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:09,684
she's really bad
at reading people.

187
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:11,720
But I'm good at reading people.

188
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:16,228
My secret: I look for
the worst in them.

189
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,299
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

190
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,070
I know she was
devastated by it

191
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:23,009
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

192
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:27,317
Her most recent foray--

193
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,188
Michael Hansen.

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,559
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

195
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,562
No LinkedIn, no Facebook,
nothing.

196
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:35,599
Something about him bugs me,

197
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:37,603
scratching that part
of my mind again.

198
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,242
But I'll hack him soon enough.
I always do.

199
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:41,711
I know you're not
yelling like before,

200
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,448
which is good.

201
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,354
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

202
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:48,792
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

203
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,531
You're angry at everyone,
at society...

204
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,101
Fuck society.

205
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,737
I know you have a lot
to be angry about,

206
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,407
but keeping it to yourself

207
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,742
and staying quiet
like you're doing--

208
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:00,181
it's not going to
help you.

209
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,252
There's pain underneath.

210
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,790
That's where our work
needs to go.

211
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,804
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

212
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,754
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,760
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

214
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,730
was a great man,
even when we knew

215
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:29,872
he made billions off the backs
of children?

216
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,478
Or maybe it's that it feels
like all our heroes

217
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,415
are counterfeit.

218
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,488
The world itself's
just one big hoax.

219
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,393
Spamming each other

220
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,630
with our running commentary
of bullshit

221
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:45,202
masquerading as insight,
our social media

222
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,373
faking as intimacy.

223
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,746
Or is it that we voted
for this?

224
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,884
Not with our rigged
elections,

225
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:55,823
but with our things,
our property, our money.

226
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,393
I'm not saying
anything new.

227
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,264
We all know why
we do this,

228
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,501
not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy

229
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,773
but because
we wanna be sedated.

230
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,409
Because it's painful
not to pretend,

231
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:08,616
because we're cowards.

232
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:10,352
Fuck society.

233
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,789
<i>Elliot.</i>

234
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,991
Elliot.

235
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,730
You're not saying
anything.

236
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:17,834
What's wrong?

237
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:20,138
Nothing.

238
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,382
Don't be frustrated.

239
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:28,387
Why shouldn't I be?

240
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,362
You're different
than most.

241
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:35,234
You at least try.

242
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:37,873
You at least
understand.

243
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,946
Understand what?

244
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:43,918
What it's like
to feel alone.

245
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,394
You understand the pain.

246
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:51,098
You want to protect
people from it.

247
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,804
You want to protect me
from it.

248
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:58,112
I respect that
about you.

249
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,124
Why do you think
I know

250
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,694
what it's like
to feel alone?

251
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,066
Shit! From her emails!

252
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,802
Elliot?

253
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,006
I don't know.

254
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,448
Let's talk about
last night.

255
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,220
Did you go to Angela's
birthday party?

256
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,735
Yeah. It was nice.

257
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:29,440
Did you try to talk
to anyone?

258
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,177
Sure.

259
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,248
I got a girl's number.

260
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,151
- You did?
- [chuckles]

261
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,088
She's cute.

262
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,893
<i>She likes
The Hunger Games.</i>

263
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:47,008
You're hiding again,
Elliot.

264
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,985
When you hide,
your delusions come back.

265
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:54,289
It's a slippery slope.

266
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,565
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

267
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,402
Are they still there?

268
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:07,481
No, I...
told you they're gone.

269
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:10,420
The meds you gave me
are working.

270
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,501
Yo, man.

271
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,104
Do you wanna, uh...

272
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:21,107
you wanna do lunch
today?

273
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,510
Uh, yeah...

274
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,948
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

275
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,522
That's...what you said the last
three times I asked you.

276
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,960
Look, bud, you...

277
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,997
and Angela
have been close

278
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,936
for a long time,
and that's even more reason

279
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,375
why I want us to be
on good terms.

280
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,113
I-I just--I feel like
things have been

281
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:44,219
awkward between us.
Don't you?

282
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:46,624
I'm okay with it
being awkward between us.

283
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,995
Um, yeah.

284
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:52,101
I-I'm--I'm not
okay with that.

285
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:55,073
Um...look, man,
I love Angela,

286
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:58,681
and I want us to--
to get along for her sake.

287
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:01,553
I mean, that's what I'm--
that's what I'm here for.

288
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,691
I just, I...
I don't normally do stuff...

289
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,194
Am I crazy not to like this guy?

290
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,333
Among some of
his Facebook likes

291
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,337
are George W. Bush's
Decision Points,

292
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,708
Transformers 2:
Revenge of the Fallen,

293
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,179
and the music of Josh Groban.

294
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,718
Must I really justify myself
any further?

295
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,455
I'm working on
that shit, you know?

296
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:25,299
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

297
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,971
I witnessed his first
"I love you" with Angela

298
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,175
over Gchat,

299
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:31,745
then I witnessed the first
of many infidelities

300
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,415
with Stella B.

301
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,755
I've never done
anything like this before...

302
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,093
I've thought about
telling Angela,

303
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:40,463
but she has shitty taste
in men,

304
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,732
and I'm not quite ready

305
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,334
to see what comes after this
just yet.

306
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,504
You like music.
I like music.

307
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,073
Maroon 5.

308
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,277
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

309
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,748
for now, anyway.

310
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,484
And that's all I mean.
[sighs]

311
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,086
I just want you
to know that.

312
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,492
I like you, bro,
and...

313
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,796
I want you
to like me too.

314
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,100
I understand.

315
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,637
I'll try harder.

316
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,342
That's cool, man.

317
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:08,250
Hey, whenever you're
ready, I'd love to just...

318
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,320
chill.

319
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:16,565
Oh--forgot about your...
no touching thing.

320
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:22,812
Truth is, I shouldn't hate
Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

321
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,749
He's too dumb to be bad.

322
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:28,824
In fact, when I think about
the really bad people...

323
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:35,803
E Corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

324
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,678
they're so big,
they're literally everywhere.

325
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,249
A perfect monster
of modern society.

326
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:45,388
The E might as well
stand for Evil.

327
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,426
And all of life's necessities...

328
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:50,265
In fact, after a thorough,
intensive self-reprogramming,

329
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,169
that's all my mind hears,
sees, or reads

330
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,705
when they pop up
in my world.

331
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,442
That was have to offer.

332
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,613
Together, we can change the world,

333
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,382
with E... Evil Corp.

334
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:02,588
Krista would have a shit fit
if she knew I did that.

335
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,797
But that's what they are--
a conglomerate of evil.

336
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,433
And now I have to help them.

337
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,839
There are six on-site engineers
on your account.

338
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,876
- Plus a few off-site...
- There he is, Terry Colby,

339
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,181
the CTO.

340
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,750
Even though he's the head
technology guy

341
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,453
at one of the biggest
companies in the world,

342
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:20,457
he owns a Blackberry.

343
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,460
So this is it
right here.

344
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,866
But also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

345
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:28,706
He's not a techie.
He's a moron.

346
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,947
An arrogant moron.
The worst kind.

347
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:40,463
Oh, hi.
Tyrell Wellick.

348
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,767
I'm Senior Vice President,
Technology.

349
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:47,343
Elliot. Just a tech.

350
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,980
Don't be so humble.

351
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:51,918
You know, I started out
exactly where you are,

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,622
and...to be honest,
you know,

353
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,359
my heart is still
there.

354
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:57,998
So I see you're
running Gnome.

355
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,638
You know, I'm actually
on KDE myself.

356
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,940
I know this desktop
environment

357
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,810
is supposed to be better
but...

358
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,613
you know what
they say.

359
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:08,651
Old habits--
they die hard.

360
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:10,655
An executive running Linux
with--

361
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,692
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

362
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,927
I'm an executive.
I mean...

363
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,302
why am I even running
Linux?

364
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:19,673
Again--old habits.

365
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,518
It's gonna be fun
working with you.

366
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,556
I should join
the rest of the group.

367
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,094
Bon soir, Elliot.

368
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,613
Sometimes I dream
of saving the world.

369
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:47,093
Saving everyone
from the invisible hand,

370
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,998
one that brands us
with an employee badge.

371
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:56,611
The one that forces us
to work for them...

372
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:01,788
The one that controls us
every day without us knowing it.

373
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,527
But I can't stop it.

374
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,598
I'm not that special.

375
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:10,939
I'm just anonymous.

376
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,010
I'm just alone.

377
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,554
If it weren't for Qwerty,

378
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:21,025
I'd be completely empty.

379
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:30,945
I hate when I can't hold in
my loneliness.

380
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:33,183
This crying has been
happening too often,

381
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,621
every other week now.

382
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:41,999
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

383
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:46,976
They reach out
to friends or family, I think.

384
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,955
That's not an option.

385
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:58,733
I do morphine.

386
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,170
The key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

387
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,577
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams a day.

388
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:05,913
Anything more

389
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:08,652
just builds up your tolerance.

390
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:11,658
I check every pill I get
for purity.

391
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,530
I have 8 milligram Suboxone
for maintenance

392
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:16,735
in case I go through
withdrawals.

393
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:19,741
Shit!
I'm out again.

394
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,181
How much?

395
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,854
On the house.

396
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:29,760
No, Shayla.
Not doing that.

397
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:32,933
Okay? This is just
a regular drug deal

398
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:34,937
- like it always is.
- Fine.

399
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:37,007
So what are you
you to tonight?

400
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,678
'Cause I tried to post
something on your Facebook

401
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,314
and couldn't find you.

402
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,217
I'm not on Facebook.

403
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,955
What? Why not?

404
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:46,024
'Cause I hate Facebook.

405
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,901
That's crazy.

406
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:55,911
Well...you want to
do these together then?

407
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,215
Pure Molly...

408
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,977
Don't ever make decisions

409
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,983
when you're on morphine.

410
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:27,406
Instagram check-in
for Krista at Pierre Loti.

411
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,209
Okay, Michael Hansen.

412
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:32,214
Time to find out
who you really are.

413
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:22,079
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

414
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:26,954
Taxi!

415
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:35,272
Uh, hi--I just left
my keys in one of your cabs.

416
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:37,842
56Y2.

417
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,114
Sure.

418
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,558
What about you two?
Huh?

419
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,195
You guys got any
spare change?

420
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:49,867
Help me out?

421
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,772
New York's expensive, guys.
Come on.

422
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:55,678
306 Hawthorne.
Thank you.

423
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,950
Thank you.

424
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,229
Come on, asshole
Piss already.

425
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:22,730
- Come on!

426
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:24,133
Come on!
Will you--will you go?

427
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:25,603
- Come on, go, go!
- Hey!

428
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:26,905
Go, will ya?

429
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,942
Hey.

430
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,185
May I borrow your phone?

431
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:36,925
Mine's dead.
I need to call my mom.

432
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,140
Thank you.

433
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:07,118
No answer.
Thanks anyway.

434
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,354
Angela,
is everything okay?

435
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,326
I need you to come
to AllSafe.

436
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:30,763
You're there?
It's 3:00 in the morning.

437
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,700
They attacked Evil Corp
servers again,

438
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,938
but it's bad this time.
It's a DDoS attack.

439
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,842
Did you call Lloyd?
He's on call.

440
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,879
Yeah, he's here.

441
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,050
Is he talking to
their tech department?

442
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:43,154
He's online with them,
but so far nothing.

443
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:48,231
I don't think that
Lloyd can handle this.

444
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,703
Look, Gideon just put me
on this account.

445
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,874
I can't screw up
in my first week.

446
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,943
I need you.
Please.

447
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,949
I'll be right there.

448
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,207
Finally!

449
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,977
Calm down--it's only
been an hour.

450
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,481
Yeah, well, an hour
in Evil Corp time

451
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:16,385
is like $13 million
in revenue, approximately.

452
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:17,855
Actually,
I calculated that.

453
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:19,726
That's exactly
how much they lost.

454
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,798
Don't worry.
I got you.

455
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,367
Lloyd, what's up?

456
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:26,205
- Lloyd!

457
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,277
Elliot. This is bad.

458
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,483
Worst DDoS attack
I've ever seen.

459
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:34,020
- Did you reconfigure the DNS?
- Yes!

460
00:26:34,022 --> 00:26:35,824
- Stop the services.
- I already stopped

461
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,393
the services,
tries to reboot the servers

462
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,096
but they're not
coming back up.

463
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,033
Dude, someone is straight up
fingerblasting

464
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:43,037
their entire network
right now.

465
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,506
They just started
reporting on the outage.

466
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,059
Shit. This is worse
than I thought.

467
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,328
They're in the network?

468
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,199
What's the status update?

469
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,871
I thought we set up
security protocols

470
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:19,108
so that this doesn't happen.

471
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,879
Where's the attack coming from?

472
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,281
Everywhere, obviously.

473
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,084
The USA, Finland,
Thailand, Kuwait--

474
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,888
Start restarting the services,
load sharing,

475
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,959
redirect the traffic.
Call Prolexic for help.

476
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,863
What?

477
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,902
I don't think this
is just a DDoS attack.

478
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,508
I think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

479
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,346
What's a rootkit?

480
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:41,552
It's like a crazy serial
rapist with a very big dick.

481
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,623
- Jesus, Lloyd.
- Sorry. It's malicious code

482
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,426
that completely
takes over their system.

483
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:49,233
It can delete system files
and stop programs.

484
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,435
- Viruses, worms--
- How do we stop it?

485
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,139
That's the thing.

486
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,976
It's fundamentally
invisible--you can't stop it.

487
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,045
All of their servers
are timing out.

488
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:56,514
None of them
are coming back up.

489
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:58,485
That's because
every time we restart the server

490
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,455
the virus replicates itself
during boot up

491
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,526
and crashes the host.

492
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,998
How are we supposed to
bring up the network

493
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,369
if we can't
restart the servers?

494
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,306
We can't.

495
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:11,677
Which is what they wanted.

496
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,480
By defending ourselves,

497
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:16,119
we ended up spreading
the virus everywhere.

498
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,655
Only thing we can do

499
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:19,961
is we've gotta take
the whole system offline,

500
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,563
wipe the infected servers
clean,

501
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,567
then bring them back up.

502
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:26,373
You're coming with me.

503
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,544
- Yeah.
- Lloyd.

504
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:31,016
Tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

505
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:33,453
- On it.
- Uh, the server farm in Dulles.

506
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,990
We're gonna need the jet.

507
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,622
They're booting
the network back up.

508
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:53,593
Now, you're downloading
the logs, right--

509
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:55,396
- Stop. Tell him to stop.
- What?

510
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,767
Don't start the boot sequence.
You guys missed one.

511
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,474
There's an infected server
up and running.

512
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:04,247
What's the ETA
before it hits this server?

513
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,728
The backup server
up and running?

514
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,133
It's ready, but it's not
configured for auto switch.

515
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:21,480
We need to redirect
the traffic,

516
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:23,149
need to switch DNS.

517
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,763
You got this, you got this,
you got this.

518
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:31,633
This is impossible.

519
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,804
You got this,
you got this, you got this.

520
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,175
It's almost at the back server!

521
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,297
We still up?

522
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,417
We're okay.

523
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:00,624
Yeah.

524
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:08,705
Hank.

525
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,409
I'm gonna take a look

526
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,647
at the infected server, okay?
Give me a minute.

527
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,353
Yeah. Uh...I'll meet you
at the elevators.

528
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,535
They must have left
a mark or something.

529
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,705
Every hacker loves attention.

530
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,878
They don't just do DDoS
attacks for no reason.

531
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,192
This is it.

532
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:37,362
Fsociety.

533
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:39,433
Is that supposed to be
a joke?

534
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:43,374
This was way too easy.
They didn't hide it well at all.

535
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:53,393
This note is for me.

536
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,931
They're telling me
to leave it here.

537
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:59,906
But why?
Doesn't matter.

538
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:02,178
Time to shut them down.

539
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,920
Why can't I delete it?

540
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,325
I don't want to delete it.
I want it to stay.

541
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,328
What's wrong with me?

542
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:21,080
I'll reconfigure the access
to the root directory

543
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,951
so only I can use it.

544
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:27,894
And no one will know.

545
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,496
For you, sir.

546
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,449
Did you know
that I'm gay?

547
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,521
Uh...

548
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:45,362
No.

549
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:49,904
Hmm.

550
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:54,313
Consider this me coming out
to you then, okay?

551
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,316
It's hard because I don't like
to talk about my sex life.

552
00:31:56,318 --> 00:32:00,090
But my partner,
he gets very paranoid.

553
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:03,530
He thinks I'm ashamed of--

554
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:06,269
He wants me to be
more public about it, so,

555
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,341
Anyway, I'm gay.

556
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:14,386
Thanks.

557
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:19,193
Yeah.

558
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,471
Hey, man,
don't worry about it.

559
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:26,542
Hackers have a short
attention span.

560
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,147
They'll get bored,
harass someone else.

561
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:34,257
Evil Corp is thinking
about leaving us.

562
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:39,467
And I don't know
if I can blame them.

563
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,072
They could have called
their other security teams.

564
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:45,411
- Mm.
- They called you.

565
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,583
Well, somebody over there
likes us,

566
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:50,088
but Terry Colby,
he's getting the pressure.

567
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,062
and he calls the shots.

568
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,168
Evil Corp is 80%
of our business.

569
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,508
If we lose them,
it's gonna be it for us.

570
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,681
It's gonna be it...

571
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:05,752
For me.

572
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:16,039
I feel like
I can talk to you.

573
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:21,382
I mean, more than
the others, anyway.

574
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,186
I'm sure,
in a weird way,

575
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:26,291
you'll be happy
if we went under.

576
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:27,427
Oh, come on.

577
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,132
Come on.

578
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:33,605
I know you hate
wearing those stupid shirts.

579
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,360
Gideon?

580
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,536
I promise I'll find them.

581
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,401
Evil Corp service should be
back up soon enough.

582
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:07,205
I'll take a look
at the dat file.

583
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:10,345
I'll ask my IRC contacts
about fsociety when I get home.

584
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,214
I've never seen their name
on the boards though.

585
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,752
They've gotta be new,
but they're good.

586
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,370
Rough night?

587
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,354
I'm getting off here.

588
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,658
I think you should
come with me.

589
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,363
But only if
you didn't delete it.

590
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:41,572
You deleted it,
we got nothing to talk about.

591
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:46,748
Are you talking to me?

592
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,258
Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.

593
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:04,614
Who are you?

594
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,560
We gotta wait for the Q.

595
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:17,076
Then what?

596
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:18,979
Then we're going
to Brooklyn.

597
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,985
Out by Coney Island.

598
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:26,695
Why?
What's there?

599
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,873
Obviously you're gonna ask
a lot of questions.

600
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:36,280
It's weird what you're doing
right now, I get it.

601
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:39,286
I-I can't tell you
anything

602
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:42,324
until we get there.

603
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:52,746
Can't smoke in here.

604
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,858
You've been
following me.

605
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,928
Why?

606
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:05,937
What do you want
from me?

607
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:13,185
My dad was a petty thief.

608
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:14,722
Never could hold down
a job.

609
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,024
So, he just robbed,

610
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,795
convenience stores,
shops,

611
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:20,433
small-time stuff.

612
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:21,869
One time,
he sat me down,

613
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,773
he told me something
I never forgot.

614
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:26,745
He said, "Everyone steals."

615
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:29,016
"That's how it works."

616
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:30,820
"You think people out there
are getting exactly

617
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,422
what they deserve?
No.

618
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,761
They're getting paid
over or under,

619
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:37,900
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled."

620
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,446
"I steal, Son,
but I don't get caught."

621
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:47,352
"That's my contract
with society."

622
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:50,057
"Now if you can catch me
stealing, I'll go to jail."

623
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,361
"But if you can't,

624
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:58,240
then I've earned the money."

625
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:03,049
I respected that, man.

626
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,320
I thought that shit
was cool

627
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:10,297
as a little kid.

628
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:12,834
A few years after that,

629
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:16,041
they finally caught him.

630
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:17,343
Sent him to jail.

631
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:19,848
Dies five years later.

632
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,558
My respect goes with him.

633
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,895
I thought he was free
doing what he did,

634
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:30,002
but he wasn't.

635
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:33,609
He was in prison.

636
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:36,614
Just like you are now,
Elliot.

637
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,292
But I'm gonna
break you out.

638
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:40,340
Why would you guys
actually meet IRL?

639
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,445
You remember that
hacker group O-Megz?

640
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,449
They got outed
by their own leader to the FBI,

641
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,419
and six hackers
went to prison for it?

642
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:48,588
You know how
they got 'em?

643
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,392
They went on
the dude's computer,

644
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,465
tracked 'em all down
through emails,

645
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:56,036
VPN sessions,
chat messages, texts.

646
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:58,140
One guy, and the whole thing
comes down.

647
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,777
- It's what's called--
- A central point of failure.

648
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,347
Right.

649
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,518
Because they refused
to meet in person,

650
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,421
they compromised each other
every time

651
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,257
they sent so much
as a smiley face.

652
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:08,761
The rule here is,

653
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,631
it's done here,

654
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,637
and only here.

655
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,708
It ends when you walk out
that door,

656
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,412
and begins when
you walk in.

657
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:22,120
Our encryption
is the real world.

658
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:23,657
How do you talk
to each other then?

659
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,193
We don't.

660
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:28,833
We come and go,
work on the project when we can.

661
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:31,271
How do you trust them?

662
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,108
I give them an exercise.

663
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,116
If they pass, they join us.
If they fail--

664
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:40,389
The DDoS attack last night,

665
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,460
you were testing me.

666
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:51,678
You said there was
a project.

667
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,447
What's the project?

668
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,151
That'll come later.

669
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:58,124
I just wanted you
to see the place.

670
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,140
There's not much you can
do without a CPU.

671
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,720
I'm crazy.

672
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:15,157
I have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

673
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,559
This is a delusion.

674
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:21,302
Is this a delusion?
Shit, I'm a schizo.

675
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:22,839
Have I really lost it
this time?

676
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,843
No, no. Last night happened.
It was real.

677
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,646
Angela called me.
I was at AllSafe.

678
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:28,516
Evil Corp's servers
were compromised.

679
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:30,320
Those are facts,
not delusions.

680
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:32,859
I know. I know, I know
I realize I'm saying all of this

681
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:35,197
to an imaginary person,

682
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,464
but I created you.

683
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:38,937
I didn't create this.

684
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,675
Oh, thank God you're here.

685
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:44,815
I was just about to go
wait in the Starbucks.

686
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,520
You live in a bad neighborhood.
Do you know that?

687
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:49,792
I do know that.

688
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,864
Do you want to
get high and

689
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,336
watch your favorite movie?

690
00:40:55,338 --> 00:40:56,771
Oh, you saved our asses
last night.

691
00:40:56,773 --> 00:41:00,478
I thought Gideon was
definitely gonna fire me.

692
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,647
Where have you been?

693
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:04,286
I thought you'd
be sleeping.

694
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:07,792
I--yeah, I fell asleep
on the train.

695
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:13,771
That sounds like such a lie,
but, whatever.

696
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:15,608
I don't want
to get into that right now.

697
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,949
So you want to
do this?

698
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:25,594
I miss Qwerty.

699
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,031
I hope she still loves me.

700
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,318
Shit.

701
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,355
She wasn't supposed
to be here, okay?

702
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:40,857
Give me a minute
and I'll get rid of her.

703
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,394
That's okay.

704
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,433
Um...

705
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:47,002
This is great.

706
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,004
Elliot, I'm happy
for you.

707
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,574
No, it's not like that.

708
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:51,044
Well, maybe it should be,
you know?

709
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:52,947
It's good that you're...

710
00:41:56,022 --> 00:42:00,863
dating.

711
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:03,435
Well, I'll see you
on Monday.

712
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,673
We can do movie night
next time.

713
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:07,476
I promise, okay?

714
00:42:07,478 --> 00:42:09,546
Yeah.

715
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:17,763
Have fun.

716
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,462
Mm, Elliot?

717
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:39,104
Oh, shit.
Is it Wednesday?

718
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,511
- Shayla.
- I have to move my car.

719
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:45,584
Shayla, leave.

720
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,561
Now.

721
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,503
No mention of Mr. Robot
anywhere.

722
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:56,905
No mention of fsociety.

723
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,709
Not on any of
the hacker boards.

724
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:01,013
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,

725
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:03,084
no one's heard of them.

726
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,063
Property was owned by
Fun Society Amusement, LLC

727
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:10,700
for 13 years.

728
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:13,238
Owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

729
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,074
No owner since.

730
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:16,777
And the ownership history
before that

731
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:18,848
is sparse to nonexistent.

732
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,821
This guy is good.
Very good.

733
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,768
Doesn't matter.

734
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,306
Their arcade network's IP
is in the dat file.

735
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:38,119
That'll be enough
to turn them in.

736
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:54,619
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

737
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,244
Hey, man,

738
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:11,117
where's your boss?

739
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,988
Okay, cut the bullshit.

740
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,996
When are you going to give us
access to the root directory?

741
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:18,131
What?

742
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:21,170
Dude, come on.
I wrote that rootkit.

743
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:24,242
I still have to put
Colby's IP in the dat file.

744
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:34,095
Dickhead.

745
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:36,400
Elliot!
Good news.

746
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:38,738
I scored the last bag
of Twinkies from Gristedes.

747
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,742
You want one?

748
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,278
She just called me
a dickhead.

749
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,150
Yeah, that's Darlene.

750
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:49,291
Hey, you like
Ferris wheels?

751
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:55,971
Ah, it's beautiful.

752
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,977
Gets better the higher up
you go, you know?

753
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,217
Oh, I love it up here.

754
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:05,290
You like it?

755
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:07,928
I'm here to tell you
I'm turning you in.

756
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,330
I'm giving them
all the information.

757
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:13,171
Let me tell you why
you're really here.

758
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:16,778
You're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

759
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,484
Something
you can't explain.

760
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:24,260
But you know it controls you
and everyone you care about.

761
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,264
What are you talking about?

762
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,975
Money.

763
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:35,381
Money hasn't been real since we
got off the gold standard.

764
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:38,087
It's become virtual.
Software.

765
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:41,393
The operating system
of our world.

766
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:44,466
And, Elliot,
we are on the verge

767
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:48,874
of taking down
this virtual reality.

768
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:51,480
Think about it.

769
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:56,255
What if you could take down
one conglomerate?

770
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:59,862
A conglomerate
so deeply entrenched

771
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,499
in the world's economy,

772
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:03,503
that too big to fail
doesn't even come close

773
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:05,240
to describing it.

774
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:07,878
You want to create
another financial meltdown

775
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,118
like the one we just had,
but way worse.

776
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,122
Yeah, why would
I want that?

777
00:46:13,124 --> 00:46:14,458
Everyone would lose
their money.

778
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,228
What if I told you
that this conglomerate

779
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,630
just so happens to own

780
00:46:17,632 --> 00:46:19,868
70% of the global
consumer credit industry?

781
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,204
Huh?

782
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:22,907
If we hit their data center
just right,

783
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:25,246
we could systematically format
all the servers,

784
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:27,148
- including backup.
- That would erase all--

785
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,487
All the debt we owe them.

786
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,660
Every record of every
credit card, loan, and mortgage

787
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:35,232
would be wiped clean.

788
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:36,468
It would be impossible
to reinforce

789
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,936
outdated paper records.

790
00:46:37,938 --> 00:46:40,975
It would all be gone.

791
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:43,581
The single biggest incident

792
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:47,656
of wealth redistribution
in history.

793
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,542
Evil Corp.
The conglomerate.

794
00:46:57,544 --> 00:46:59,446
That's why you
picked me.

795
00:46:59,448 --> 00:47:01,014
Because I work
at AllSafe.

796
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:04,187
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to
get a visit

797
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:08,262
from the FBI
and the U.S. Cyber Command.

798
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:12,705
You are going to modify
the dat file

799
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:17,548
and put Colby's
terminal IP address in there.

800
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,186
Terry Colby?

801
00:47:20,188 --> 00:47:24,326
You're gonna frame him?
No one's gonna believe that.

802
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:26,631
I met him, he's a moron.

803
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,502
So are the FBI.

804
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:30,238
Even if they don't believe
he did it,

805
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,645
they'll believe
he gave someone access to it.

806
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,215
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

807
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:36,485
What good will that do?

808
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,121
You don't take down
a conglomerate

809
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,058
by shooting them
in the heart.

810
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,628
That's the thing
about conglomerates,

811
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,632
they don't have hearts.

812
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:46,403
You take them down
limb by limb.

813
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,806
And as they unravel,

814
00:47:47,808 --> 00:47:51,079
their illusion
of control unravels.

815
00:47:57,093 --> 00:48:00,497
Who are you?

816
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,068
That'll come later.

817
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,710
Right now, you have a lot
to think about.

818
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:09,347
You have to change
the dat file

819
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:12,420
and put Colby's IP
in there.

820
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,631
You do that,

821
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:19,802
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

822
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:23,175
the world will ever see.

823
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:40,175
¶ If you go away ¶

824
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:44,283
¶ On this summer day ¶

825
00:48:44,285 --> 00:48:49,326
¶ Then you might as well
take the sun away ¶

826
00:48:49,328 --> 00:48:51,430
¶ All the birds that flew ¶

827
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:55,237
¶ In a summer sky ¶

828
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:56,941
¶ When our love was new ¶

829
00:48:56,943 --> 00:49:00,414
¶ And our hearts were high ¶

830
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,552
¶ When the day was young ¶

831
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:06,193
¶ And the night was long ¶

832
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:07,595
¶ And the moon stood still ¶

833
00:49:07,597 --> 00:49:10,801
¶ For the night birds song ¶

834
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:14,442
¶ If you go away ¶

835
00:49:14,444 --> 00:49:17,781
¶ If you go away ¶

836
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:20,921
¶ If you go away ¶

837
00:49:20,923 --> 00:49:24,461
¶ But if you stay ¶

838
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:27,334
¶ I'll make you a day ¶

839
00:49:27,336 --> 00:49:30,006
¶ Like no day's been ¶

840
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,979
¶ Or will be again ¶

841
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:35,750
¶ We'll sail on the sun ¶

842
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:38,756
¶ We'll ride on the rain ¶

843
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:41,628
¶ We'll talk to the trees ¶

844
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,700
¶ And worship the wind ¶

845
00:49:44,702 --> 00:49:46,904
¶ Then if you go ¶

846
00:49:46,906 --> 00:49:49,910
¶ I'll understand ¶

847
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:53,351
¶ Leave me just enough love ¶

848
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:55,756
¶ To fill up my hand ¶

849
00:49:55,758 --> 00:49:58,995
¶ If you go away ¶

850
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:02,502
¶ If you go away ¶

851
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:07,979
¶ If you go away ¶

852
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:11,920
¶ If you go away ¶

853
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:16,363
¶ As I know you must ¶

854
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:17,799
¶ There'll be nothing left ¶

855
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:22,007
¶ In the world to trust ¶

856
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:23,877
¶ Just an empty room ¶

857
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:28,085
¶ Full of empty space ¶

858
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:29,688
¶ Like the empty look ¶

859
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,030
¶ I see on your face ¶

860
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,934
¶ Can I tell you now ¶

861
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:39,408
¶ As you turn to go ¶

862
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,679
¶ I'll be dying slowly ¶

863
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:45,687
¶ Till your next hello ¶

864
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:49,494
¶ If you go away ¶

865
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:52,833
¶ If you go away ¶

866
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:55,506
¶ If you go away ¶

867
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:59,347
So, what do we got?

868
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:01,251
So, if you'll take a look

869
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:02,754
at the first page
of your agenda--

870
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:06,228
You're the one
who stopped the hack.

871
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,334
You know, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

872
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,769
All things being equal,

873
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:13,341
it should have shut us down
for days, so...

874
00:51:13,343 --> 00:51:15,779
you did good.

875
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,319
Okay.

876
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:22,726
We should start with
our account executive, Angela.

877
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:24,530
Okay, we first noticed
the breach

878
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:28,538
at 2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard
on Friday night.

879
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,210
You mean, Saturday?

880
00:51:31,212 --> 00:51:34,482
Sorry, yes,
technically, Saturday morning.

881
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:37,521
Yeah, okay, Angela,
that's what we're here for.

882
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:39,826
The technicals.

883
00:51:39,828 --> 00:51:42,098
Right.

884
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,767
Yes.

885
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:47,108
Anyway, he arrived at the office
at 2:35 and I instru--

886
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,112
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
So that's almost a half hour

887
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:50,447
after the initial breach.

888
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:52,318
Why didn't anyone pipe in
from their laptops?

889
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,122
- It's not protocol--
- It wouldn't have been secure

890
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:58,529
if someone terminaled in
on this.

891
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:02,237
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

892
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:04,174
so they can log in
on a secure line.

893
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:05,376
Exactly.
Then Lloyd was able to--

894
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:09,684
Just--just actually,
just one second.

895
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:13,792
- Yeah.

896
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:24,680
You know, I, uh,

897
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:28,721
I always loved
this view.

898
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,788
Now that that's taken care of,

899
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,560
let's pick it up
where we left off.

900
00:52:48,562 --> 00:52:49,862
What happened to Angela?

901
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:51,700
She knows more
about what happened.

902
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,904
She's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

903
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:55,808
We need to stick
to the more tech savvy here.

904
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,586
Now, let's get to the heart
of this thing

905
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,723
because I can't sit here

906
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:07,964
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

907
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:12,339
All right, just who did this?
Is it that hard?

908
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:16,014
Who did this?

909
00:53:16,016 --> 00:53:18,385
I found the configuration file
of the rootkit

910
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:21,525
with a pattern
of IP addresses.

911
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:28,337
Once you decrypt it, you'll know
where the hack came from.

912
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:41,530
19 days.

913
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:50,445
No news, no arrests,
no revolution.

914
00:54:00,968 --> 00:54:05,041
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

915
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,007
No Mr. Robot.

916
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,078
No fsociety.

917
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:34,832
I need to take
my mind off things.

918
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,721
Hello.

919
00:54:46,723 --> 00:54:49,962
Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E
security fraud department.

920
00:54:49,964 --> 00:54:51,866
Unfortunately
I have to inform you

921
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:53,669
that your account's
been compromised.

922
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:55,673
What? What happened?

923
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:57,742
First before I can
answer any questions,

924
00:54:57,744 --> 00:54:59,246
I need to verify
some information.

925
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:01,684
Are you still at
306 Hawthorne Avenue?

926
00:55:01,686 --> 00:55:03,721
Yes. Apartment 2C.

927
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:06,093
Great.
And your security question,

928
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,262
favorite baseball team?

929
00:55:07,264 --> 00:55:09,533
Um, Yankees.

930
00:55:09,535 --> 00:55:11,070
I don't remember this
being a security question.

931
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:12,606
And lastly, your pet's name?

932
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:14,877
Um, Flipper.

933
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:18,684
Who am I speaking to?
Can I get your name and number?

934
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:21,022
With those details plus
a dictionary brute-force attack,

935
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:25,230
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

936
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,085
What I wouldn't give
to be normal.

937
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:39,158
To live in that bubble,

938
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,963
the reality of the naive.

939
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:50,045
That's how I justify this.

940
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,152
To keep their optimism intact.

941
00:55:53,154 --> 00:55:56,625
To protect them.

942
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,337
How? He's too old
to have a complicated password.

943
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,208
It had to have been
a combination of these things.

944
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:10,285
I'm missing something,
I'm missing something,

945
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:14,727
I'm missing something.

946
00:56:14,729 --> 00:56:16,397
Michael Hansen
isn't his real name.

947
00:56:25,684 --> 00:56:27,752
Come on.
Get over here.

948
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,294
Lenny Shannon?

949
00:56:32,296 --> 00:56:34,899
Michael Hansen?

950
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:38,373
Which one are you
playing tonight?

951
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,711
You're going to stop
seeing Krista.

952
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:41,913
What the fuck

953
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:43,249
You're going to break up
with her.

954
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:46,021
You're never going
to see her again.

955
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:48,727
You're the guy
that used my phone.

956
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:51,164
You cheated on your current wife
with seven different women.

957
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:53,736
I got digital proof
of all of it.

958
00:56:53,738 --> 00:56:57,109
Ashley Madison, online escorts,
fake Facebook pages.

959
00:56:57,111 --> 00:56:59,280
I own it all.

960
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,184
And if you don't stop
seeing her,

961
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:05,325
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

962
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:06,462
The police?

963
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:12,306
Yeah, one of the escorts
was 15.

964
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:13,942
That 15 part I made up,

965
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:15,946
but he did have a proclivity
for young escorts

966
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:17,281
that helped the lie.

967
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:19,820
But I'm not gonna do
any of that

968
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:22,358
as long as you break up
with Krista.

969
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,429
Tonight.

970
00:57:28,472 --> 00:57:31,343
Done.

971
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:33,515
You're also gonna
tell her the truth.

972
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,551
That you're married,
cheat on your wife,

973
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,822
you hire hookers.

974
00:57:37,824 --> 00:57:40,961
That you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

975
00:57:40,963 --> 00:57:42,397
Why?

976
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,499
That would destroy her.

977
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,838
She thinks that...

978
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,809
We're in love.

979
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:50,346
Exactly. Krista needs to avoid
dickheads like you

980
00:57:50,348 --> 00:57:51,515
in the future.

981
00:57:51,517 --> 00:57:54,087
Her radar needs fixing.

982
00:57:54,089 --> 00:57:57,027
I'll know if you
skip any detail.

983
00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:01,201
So don't.

984
00:58:01,203 --> 00:58:04,173
And one more thing...

985
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,112
I'm gonna need
something from you.

986
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,991
Come on.

987
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:28,254
Hmm.
I like you, Flipper.

988
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:31,526
You're cool.

989
00:58:31,528 --> 00:58:33,631
I never want to be right
about my hacks,

990
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:36,403
but people always find a way
to disappoint.

991
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:47,024
Michael Hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

992
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:49,395
Forever buried
in my digital cemetery.

993
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:00,650
The look of disillusionment.

994
00:59:00,652 --> 00:59:03,222
He told her.
She cried all night.

995
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:05,327
Now comes the sadness.

996
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:11,304
I don't like
seeing her sad.

997
00:59:11,306 --> 00:59:14,544
- You okay?
- Sorry.

998
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:18,151
Sorry.

999
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:21,358
Go on.

1000
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,662
I think Angela blames me
for what happened

1001
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:26,134
at the Evil Corp meeting.

1002
00:59:26,136 --> 00:59:28,472
What do I do?
I need to talk to her.

1003
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:31,777
I think you just answered
your own question.

1004
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:33,381
Talk to her.

1005
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:36,153
She won't respond
to any of my texts or emails.

1006
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,224
Then go to her
in person.

1007
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:41,397
Tell her you need
to talk.

1008
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:44,770
Communication is key,
Elliot.

1009
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:50,047
Real human interaction.

1010
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:52,751
That's what's important
for you right now.

1011
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:06,479
Hey.
Do you--

1012
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,750
- Do you think we can talk?
- What?

1013
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:10,353
You won't talk to me.

1014
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:11,756
You haven't talked to me
since the meeting.

1015
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:13,259
I don't want to talk to you

1016
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:16,631
because I feel embarrassed

1017
01:00:16,633 --> 01:00:18,735
every time I think
about what happened.

1018
01:00:18,737 --> 01:00:20,606
Okay?

1019
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:23,645
It's fine.
I'll get over it.

1020
01:00:23,647 --> 01:00:24,848
- It's been three weeks.
- I have to get back to work.

1021
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,518
You're just going to
ignore me?

1022
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,324
You didn't have to
stick up for me in there.

1023
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,759
I know that you were
just trying to help,

1024
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:34,400
just don't do it again.

1025
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:36,237
Even if I'm losing.

1026
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,745
Let me lose, okay?

1027
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,317
Don't look confused.

1028
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:46,457
Just say it.

1029
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:51,400
"Okay."

1030
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,471
Okay.

1031
01:01:08,402 --> 01:01:10,470
Elliott.

1032
01:01:28,406 --> 01:01:31,444
FBI agents claim that Colby
either used hacking groups

1033
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:33,448
or worked in conjunction
with them

1034
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,855
to pressure Evil Corp during
his contract negotiations.

1035
01:01:36,857 --> 01:01:39,694
After a long and exhaustive
investigation,

1036
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,936
sources close to the FBI
have confirmed the hacks were

1037
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:47,541
in part tied
to Colby's terminal.

1038
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:54,055
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

1039
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:04,810
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

1040
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:25,884
Sir, step inside
the car.

1041
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:31,127
Sir.

1042
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:37,373
Step inside
the vehicle now.

1043
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,871
Go ahead.

1044
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:12,943
Sir, go on in.

1045
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:18,719
Sir, go on in.

1046
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:14,829
Bon soir, Elliot.

1047
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:18,971
Please tell me
you're seeing this, too.
