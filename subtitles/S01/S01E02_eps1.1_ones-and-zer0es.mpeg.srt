1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,090
Evil Corp.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,130
Tyrell Wellick.

4
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:08,609
You want to do these together then?

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,779
Pure Molly...

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,750
No, Shayla.

7
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,359
I need you to come to AllSafe.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,619
Shit. They're in the network?

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,599
This is it. Fsociety.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
They're telling me to leave it here.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,200
Who are you?

12
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,410
I think you should come with me.

13
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,019
Yeah, that's Darlene.

14
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,059
You are going to modify the dat file

15
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,539
put Colby's IP in there.

16
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,400
You do that,

17
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,120
you have set in motion the largest
revolution the world will ever see.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,609
Sources have confirmed the hacks were

19
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,869
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

20
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,670
Sir, step inside the car.

21
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,570
Bon soir, Elliot.

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,950
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,630
but give a man a bank, and
he can rob the world."

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,949
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,000
A little reductive, but still...

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,440
I like it,

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,479
for the same reason most people hate it,

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,839
because to me it means that

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,370
power belongs to the people that take it.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,549
Nothing to do with their
hard work, strong ambitions,

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,790
or rightful qualifications, no.

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,500
The actual will to take is often
the only thing that's necessary.

33
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,130
Technically what we're doing
might be considered illegal,

35
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,819
which is why I'm surrounded

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,960
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,120
Elliot Alderson...

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,570
I want to offer you

39
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,340
a position here at Evil Corp.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,730
I want you to head our
cybersecurity division.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,030
Except I can't officially
offer you anything

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,430
since we have this non-compete
with your employer, Allsafe.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,790
But if you do this of your own accord...

44
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,450
when you do this...

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,380
you'll be a multi-millionaire
within the next five years.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
What do you say?

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Can I...

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,190
Can I think about it?

49
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
Gentlemen, I need the room.

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
You know,

52
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,790
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,620
It won't be long until it's official.

54
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,030
I will be the youngest executive
this company has ever seen.

55
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,399
I should track down these hackers out there

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,820
just to thank them.

57
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,430
In a way, it's kind of, um...

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
What's the word in English?

59
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,440
Serendipitous? Right?

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,930
You know, by the end of the quarter,

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,399
we're going to revamp our entire network

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,890
and consolidate our security protocols.

63
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,050
We're going to handle
everything internally,

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,149
which means all of our
vendors, including Allsafe,

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,640
will be cut loose.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
And it's no secret that once
Allsafe loses us as a client,

67
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,480
they'll be fini.

68
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,750
And when that happens,

69
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,090
I want you to be where you belong:

70
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,840
here with me.

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,580
This is an important choice
you're making, Elliot.

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,489
I just wanted you to know all the facts

73
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
before you made your final decision.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,390
I think I'm happy where I am.

75
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,690
Well, I thought I'd ask.

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,529
Call this number if you need to
get in touch with Mr. Wellick.

77
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,180
You can call me Mr. X.

78
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,190
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

79
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,530
Oliver Stone movie?

80
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,040
Sir, I gotta be honest.
That's embarrassing.

81
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,480
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

82
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,950
And pay, for Christ's sake.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Anyway, you can call me Mr.
Sutherland for now.

84
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
Don't hesitate to reach
me when you're ready.

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,870
We're always close by.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,979
I'm gonna set a date right now...

87
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,009
- No, we're not. - For later.

88
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,389
I gotta go, thank you very much.

89
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,840
- You gonna have me up? - No.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,439
- Gonna have me up? - No, stop.

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,930
- I'm coming up.
- No, you're not coming up.

92
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,490
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

93
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,620
Come on.

94
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,369
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, he's just a creeper.

95
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,880
I hate it when your employers
can't take a hint.

96
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,369
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

97
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,000
Because it's like 3,000
degrees in my apartment.

98
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,240
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

99
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,670
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,990
A little early to reup, don't you think?

101
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,710
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

102
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,759
Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr.
Stricty Pants,

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,730
but okie dokie.

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,389
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

105
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,720
No, just the morphine. It's good.

106
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
Uh, no, you made me promise
never to give you these

107
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,030
unless I had your Subs.

108
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,659
- Shayla. - No, Elliot.

109
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,490
Promises matter, okay?

110
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,620
I take this shit to heart.

111
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
Oh, my God.

112
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,889
Fine, but you have to promise
me you won't do a lot

113
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,599
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,610
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

115
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,570
No, you have to say it.

116
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,400
I promise.

117
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,090
Hey, man.

118
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,109
What, you think I forgot about you?

119
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,210
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

120
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,830
We gotta get to work.

121
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,459
Hacking Tyrell Wellick,
you'd think it'd be tricky,

122
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,959
but it wasn't... Evil Corp's
corporate mail servers,

123
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,219
they haven't patched
anything since Shellshock.

124
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,039
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,829
His password was just
his wife's maiden name

126
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,520
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

127
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,929
One six away from the obvious, but still,

128
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,890
this is bad noob practice.

129
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,900
These emails...

130
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,959
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

131
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,540
This doesn't make sense.

132
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,070
Did he know I was going to hack him?

133
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,220
Did he let me?

134
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

135
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,370
I know, I know, taking more than I should.

136
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm breaking my rule, but
come on, it's an off week.

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Come on.

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,610
My man, you gotta...

139
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,600
You gotta deuce it out
over here, all right?

140
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,390
Yo, you gotta do your business
up in here, all right?

141
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,840
You got this. You got this.

142
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,999
Terry Colby, the chief
technology officer of...

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.

144
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,540
Screen. Might as well be
the same thing nowadays.

145
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,649
How do I go back to work after this?

146
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,520
How can I focus on anything?

147
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,069
And when's Mr. Robot going
to contact me again?

148
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
What's he waiting for?

149
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,960
Did I just destroy a man's
life for no reason?

150
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,889
I'm gonna talk to HR about
a salary bump for you.

151
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,479
- Oh, please. - No, no.

152
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
Take the raise.

153
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,240
It's not gonna be much, but it's
the best I can do right now.

154
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,650
Elliot...

155
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,460
You saved the company.

156
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,290
Now...

157
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,350
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

158
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,899
You could've come in here at
any time before the meeting

159
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
to say you found something, but you didn't.

160
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,950
I gotta be honest. I found
that kind of curious.

161
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

162
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,439
Could've easily been a junk file.

163
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
C'mon...

164
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,869
You're never sure about anything

165
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,170
unless there's something to be sure about.

166
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,060
Maybe you don't know me that well.

167
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Regardless,

168
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,700
I still need you to stay
on it, now more than ever.

169
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,099
I mean, who knows what these fsociety
hackers are going to do next.

170
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
What did he just say?

171
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,710
- What did you just say?
- The ones working with Colby.

172
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Who knows how deep these
data dumps are going to get,

173
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,429
and Evil Corp is...

174
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,840
What're you talking about?

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,140
There's a twist.

176
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,010
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

177
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

178
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,480
Potentially terabytes worth
of emails and files.

179
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,319
They're threatening to dump everything

180
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,550
unless the FBI frees Colby.

181
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,480
They released the video this morning.

182
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,060
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

183
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,190
Over the years, we have been watching you.

184
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,159
Your financial abuse of the poor;

185
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,099
your corruption of governments;

186
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,079
your cover-ups of the murder of
innocent, ordinary citizens,

187
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,100
all for the sake of a profit.

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
This is why we at fsociety
have decided you must die.

189
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,949
We are malicious and hostile.
We do not compromise.

190
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,610
We are relentless.

191
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,619
We will not stop until every tentacle

192
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,629
of your evil monstrosity is
sliced off at the nerve.

193
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,009
But we are also not without mercy.

194
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,670
Our latest hack was our last warning.

195
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,410
Meet our demands, and we will
consider not destroying you.

196
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,919
First, release our leader Terry Colby

197
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,230
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

198
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,459
Second, release all the people of the world

199
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,820
from your even more
illegitimate prisons of debt.

200
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,439
Third, dissolve your corporation

201
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,320
and donate all your assets to
charities around the world.

202
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,629
This proposal is non-negotiable.

203
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,299
The people are realizing they
don't have freedom of choice

204
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,829
so long as you exist.

205
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,640
The people are waking up,

206
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,550
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

207
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,459
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

208
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,360
Consider yourself warned.

209
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,400
Play it again.

210
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,710
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,470
Yo, please buy my CD.
Only cost you 20 likes.

212
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,100
Yo, it'll give you the
feels, y'all, I swear.

213
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,219
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

214
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,480
Help my social media outreach.

215
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,909
You know, be like, "I want
to set up this meeting.

216
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,449
It's like a very, like a..."

217
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,709
Oh, Elliot!

218
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey, congrats, man.

219
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,789
Allsafe is all over the
internet today because of you.

220
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,429
Dude, we should celebrate.
We have this Groupon

221
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,569
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

222
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,759
This other couple we were
going with totally bailed.

223
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,849
Why don't you come with?

224
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,909
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95...

225
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,389
I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.

226
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,530
Yeah, okay.

227
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,029
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

228
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,590
And, hey, why don't we
make it a double date?

229
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,070
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

230
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,409
Ollie, you weren't
supposed to say anything.

231
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,869
Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.

232
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,159
Yeah, okay, sure. I... have to go.

233
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,660
Um, my neighbor's complaining
about the dog barking again.

234
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,690
Since when does he have a dog?

235
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,790
You look like a beautiful couple.

236
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,199
Yo, my album just dropped,

237
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,730
You like rap, hip-hop?

238
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,600
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

239
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,389
Yo, your girl will like
this, my man, I swear.

240
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,509
Come on, bro, you've been outside
our building for two weeks now.

241
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,230
All right, you know, I'll take it,

242
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
if you leave us alone.

243
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,389
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

244
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,719
And I'll tweet, but only
if I like it, all right?

245
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,539
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

246
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,899
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Some tastemakers in there so...

247
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,330
I feel you, I feel you.

248
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,130
- Yeah. - All right.

249
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,860
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

250
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,939
- You guys have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

251
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,630
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

252
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,500
- Track two. - All right, man.

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,010
This was never part of the plan.

254
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,209
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

255
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,830
None of this makes sense.

256
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,520
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
Need to disconnect.

258
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,210
We need to call in sick and lie low for a...

259
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,819
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

260
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,680
Don't stare at me!

261
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,479
Why the hell are you in my shower?

262
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,469
Well, I was waiting for you.

263
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,719
You were supposed to come last night.

264
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,300
- Did you forget? - Come? Where?

265
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

266
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm stealing your clothes.

267
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,450
My dress has cum stains on it.

268
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,289
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

269
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,559
My stuff is just in the wash.

270
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

271
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,290
Oh, by the way,

272
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,430
your dog shat on your bed.

273
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,830
You gotta walk that thing.

274
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,770
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

275
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,400
She probably needs a walk or something.

276
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,119
She keeps shitting everywhere.

277
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,289
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

278
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,529
She's a friggin' dog.

279
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,520
Yo, I want to stop and get
some froyo before we go.

280
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,080
Uh, I'll be back later.

281
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,740
- I owe you. - Yeah, big time.

282
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,090
How do you know where I live?

283
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,140
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

284
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,210
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

285
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,250
I don't live anywhere at the present.

286
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,490
The douche I was dating proposed
to me, can you believe?

287
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,720
I mean, what an asshole.

288
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,750
Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and...

289
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,899
What the hell am I doing?

290
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,529
This chick is out of her
mind batshit crazy.

291
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,539
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

292
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,859
He'll understand, right?

293
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,249
He'll know what to do.

294
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,709
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

295
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,989
He's just gotta get over this whole

296
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,340
"Love is forever" bullshit.

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,729
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

298
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,720
and then he'll come to his senses.

299
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,940
- Stand clear of the closing door.
- You know, it's our thing.

300
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,260
Quick!

301
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,329
Can she see them, too?

302
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
What?

303
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,400
I like to stay on my toes.

304
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,549
Speaking of, that's, like, one
of the most annoying things...

305
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,110
But what if Tyrell finds out?
What will he do?

306
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,579
Shit, there's basically
no scenario in which

307
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,610
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

308
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,020
Because I wanted a turtle,
and he was like, "No..."

309
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,209
I might need to crash with
you for a couple of nights.

310
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,730
That's cool, right?

311
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,880
Seriously?

312
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,560
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

313
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,709
Don't love dogs anyway.

314
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,709
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

315
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,599
I mean, how do you live
like that, honestly?

316
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,659
How do you go to sleep when
you know that there's...

317
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,270
For all we know,

318
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,579
I could be walking into a trap right now.

319
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,919
We could be dead the second
I walk through that door.

320
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,610
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,980
Big things.

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,620
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

323
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
Goddamn ducks.

324
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,850
Hey, hey, man!

325
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,039
What's... Oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

326
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,299
Um, okay.

327
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,089
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

328
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,010
Really awesome.

329
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,380
Right on, man. Right on.

330
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,709
- Real cool. - Great.

331
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,400
So now that we're all done
going down on each other,

332
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,659
can we please hear the plan?

333
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

334
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,659
If I'm not mistaken,

335
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,349
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

336
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,309
and we still haven't made the
Colby project disappear.

337
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,230
Seriously?

338
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,420
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

339
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,719
would have been owned by now.

340
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,209
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

341
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,639
- Thank you. - I mean, um...

342
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,790
if it makes you feel better,
Romero and I can check...

343
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,010
Great! Make me feel great.

344
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm gonna hang back over
here, collect my thoughts.

345
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
What's her deal?

346
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,079
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

347
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,980
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

348
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,030
She showed up at my apartment.

349
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,229
Why does she know where I live?

350
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,249
Let's not focus on her.

351
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,929
That'll be like entering a bad
K-hole you'll never wake up from.

352
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,589
Instead, I need you to focus on
the next phase of our project.

353
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,120
Comet, the natural gas
plant up around Albany?

354
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,900
We're gonna blow it up.

355
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,580
Why would you blow...

356
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,159
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

357
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,779
Which, as you know,

358
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,590
is the off-site and data storage facility

359
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,399
for every corporation in the S&P,

360
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,459
including everyone's favorite...

361
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,350
- Evil Corp. - Bingo!

362
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,520
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

363
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,130
They're gonna be looking out
for something like that.

364
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,759
They've been on high alert
ever since the hack.

365
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,209
From what I heard, they've
caught their hacker.

366
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,530
- Haven't they? - No, they haven't.

367
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,209
- Tyrell Wellick knows.
- What they want him to know!

368
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,349
He's a corporate robot just
like the rest of them.

369
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,529
Besides, the entire company
is gonna be reeling

370
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,399
from all the data dumps we've
got in store for them...

371
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,179
and man, do we have some goodies.

372
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,889
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

373
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,770
sexism, Fascism.

374
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,199
Trust me, we are gonna "ism"
so much all over them

375
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,689
they won't be able to see straight.

376
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,909
And asking for Colby's release
as ransom was genius.

377
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,549
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

378
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,000
keeping it off us.

379
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,340
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

380
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,200
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

381
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,450
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

382
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,739
And while all that's going on,

383
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,199
you will use your Allsafe
security clearance

384
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,649
to hack the Comet PLC,
increase the pressure,

385
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,429
causing a gas pipeline explosion

386
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,180
making Steel Mountain go kablooey
along with Evil Corp's soul.

387
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
They know about all this?

388
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,020
You're the first.

389
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,650
Workers?

390
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,160
Anyone living around the plant...

391
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,730
They all die?

392
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,359
We'll give them a head start.

393
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

394
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,429
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

395
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,749
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

396
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,260
not because of those who do evil,

397
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,890
but because of those who
look on and do nothing.

398
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
This is war.

399
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,940
People will die. C'est la mort.

400
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,410
And once we blow up the pipeline,

401
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,859
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

402
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,899
at the U.S. Data center

403
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,530
which you helped to us
install, thank you very much.

404
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,720
The redundant backups at their
eastern data center in China...

405
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,640
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

406
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,590
Dark Army? Why, man?

407
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,569
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

408
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,369
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

409
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,600
Which means they hate U.S.
capitalism just as much as anyone.

410
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,660
Last but not least.

411
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,130
Steel Mountain.

412
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,280
The hacker's dilemma.

413
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,369
What to do when a bunch of
data you want to destroy

414
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,170
is completely off the grid?

415
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm not killing anyone.

416
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

417
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you a one or a zero?

418
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,309
That's the question you
have to ask yourself.

419
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,140
Are you a yes or a no?

420
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,580
Are you going to act or not?

421
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,250
Yo... you've been staring
at a computer screen

422
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,180
way too long, homie.

423
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,139
Life's not that binary.

424
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,370
Isn't it?

425
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,980
Sure, there are grays...

426
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,410
but when you come right
down to it, at its core,

427
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,190
beneath every choice, there's
either a one or a zero.

428
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,950
You either do something or you don't.

429
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,099
You walk out that door,
you've decided to do nothing,

430
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,450
to say no, which means
you do not come back.

431
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,980
You leave, you are no
longer a part of this.

432
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,550
You become a zero.

433
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,740
If you stay,

434
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,440
if you want to change the world,

435
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,810
you become a yes.

436
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,050
You become a one.

437
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,580
So, I'll ask you again:

438
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,180
are you a one or a zero?

439
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,409
An innocent man is in prison
because of what I did.

440
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,250
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

441
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,170
This has nothing to do with Colby.

442
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,730
This isn't even about my revolution.

443
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,310
This is more than that for you.

444
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,309
This is about how those bastards
slowly killed your father

445
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,019
and how you wished he'd
done something about it.

446
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,909
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

447
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,030
just like you're being right now.

448
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
F... you.

449
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,080
Disappearing again?

450
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm not killing anyone.
Leave me out of this.

451
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,750
You don't get to disappear from this.

452
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,259
We can do it with or without you,

453
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,150
but you're a part of it either way!

454
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,870
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
can't protect you, bitch!

455
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,089
This was a mistake.

456
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,049
I've gotta turn them in.
Should I turn them in?

457
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,379
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

458
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,009
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

459
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,550
You're in this with me, so start
thinking of solutions now.

460
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,460
Shayla?

461
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,730
Yo, Shayla.

462
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
Yo, bro.

463
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,890
Can I help you with something?

464
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,500
I, uh... just need to talk to Shayla.

465
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh, your girl.

466
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,940
She in the tub.

467
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,450
Shayla.

468
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:58,460
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

469
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,320
Can sit and wait if you want.

470
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,930
I think we should check on her,
make sure she's all right.

471
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,950
You a funny dude. I like you.

472
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
Don't be rude.

473
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
Sit down and chill.

474
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,360
No, that's right.

475
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,890
You only do this.

476
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,780
Only nigga I know that take
withdrawal meds while he using.

477
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,660
That's smart.

478
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,270
Probably even convinced
yourself you ain't an addict.

479
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,020
Oh, shit.

480
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,689
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan...

481
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,429
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

482
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,350
One of the worst human
beings I've ever hacked.

483
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,250
His password? "Eatadick6969."

484
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,839
Aside from the massive amounts of
money he spends on porn and webcams,

485
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,650
he does all his drug transactions
through emails, IMs, Twitter.

486
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,519
The fact that the cops haven't
caught him yet is beyond me.

487
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,779
If they had half a brain cell,

488
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,509
they'd be able to crack his
gang's simplistic code,

489
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250
if it can even be called that.

490
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,939
After only a couple of
hours of timing his tweets

491
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,379
with related news articles,

492
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,239
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

493
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,149
clearly referenced guns.

494
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,939
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

495
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,889
And the ultimate: "Rock to sleep early."

496
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,239
I haven't made the direct
connection to a hit yet,

497
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,969
but the math of guns plus bullets

498
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,930
usually adds up to one thing.

499
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,769
I've thought about turning him in,

500
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,740
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

501
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,039
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

502
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,299
and with everything going on
right now, I can't have that.

503
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,850
You get that, though?

504
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,950
Anyway, bro,

505
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,120
I ain't nothing to worry about.

506
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,100
Just making a drop for you.

507
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
What's your name, anyway?

508
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,720
Elliot.

509
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,460
What it mean?

510
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,189
What, you ain't never Googled it?

511
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,030
Man, you gotta do that.

512
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:15,540
The meaning of a person's
name is important, bro.

513
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,260
Yo, she good! She good.

514
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,000
Trust me.

515
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,530
Took care of that shit myself.

516
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,300
You remind me of me when I was younger,

517
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,110
depressed and sullen.

518
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,230
Matter of fact, tried to kill
myself, a couple of times.

519
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,410
Never could get that shit right.

520
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

521
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,150
I hated myself, man. Still do.

522
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,230
Thought that shit was a
weakness for a long time.

523
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,050
Then I realized that shit was my power.

524
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,410
People walk around, act like
they know what hate means.

525
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,969
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

526
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,120
I mean...

527
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,080
truly hate yourself.

528
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,230
That's power.

529
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,090
You ain't scared of me, are you?

530
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,170
That's good.

531
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,590
Means I didn't waste my time
making friends with you.

532
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
You don't really need these, do you?

533
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,090
Man of your courage can last
through a little withdrawal.

534
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,660
Ya know, you the only
reason why I met Shayla.

535
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm the only nigga in
town carrying everything,

536
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,989
including your precious Suboxone.

537
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,770
So, in a weird way, I
should be thanking you.

538
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
You brought her to me.

539
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,479
Your star orbiting with
mine, gravitationally,

540
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,810
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

541
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,069
I mean, this, us?

542
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,240
Being here?

543
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
This has...

544
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
beautiful meaning.

545
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,120
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

546
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,540
is mine.

547
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,510
I don't know what I'd do without her.

548
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,859
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

549
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,750
you had with her before,
but now that we friends...

550
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,500
I trust you respect this boundary.

551
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,610
Feel me?

552
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,860
A dude earlier today
gave me that same look.

553
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,070
Only thing I gotta say is,

554
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,540
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

555
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,260
and a stupid time.

556
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,090
Shayla?

557
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,820
The lock pick.

558
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,619
Every hacker's favorite sport.

559
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,019
The perfect system to crack,

560
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,089
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

561
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,939
when you break it, you can feel it.

562
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,840
You can see it. You can hear it.

563
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Shayla.

564
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,290
Wake up.

565
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
What happened?

566
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
You okay?

567
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,970
Why was that asshole here?

568
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
Why am I in the tub?

569
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,119
I don't know, um... I told
him I needed your pills.

570
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
He came over. We smoked a little.

571
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,250
You remember having sex with him?

572
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,080
What? No.

573
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,299
But he definitely does.

574
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
Okay, let's go.

575
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,540
- Get your purse, make sure... - Stop.

576
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

577
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,570
What do you mean?

578
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

579
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,839
You can't go back to him.
Hey, I don't need the pills.

580
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,720
- Just find someone else. - I can't.

581
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,150
He gives me a really
good deal on the split.

582
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
I make good money.

583
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,550
There it is again,

584
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:38,059
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

585
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,850
even if it pushes us past
our threshold of pain.

586
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,490
It's not gonna stop.

587
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,650
What if he does it again?

588
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,090
Promise me you won't do anything?

589
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,480
I'm serious, Elliot.

590
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,580
There's nothing to be done here.

591
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,870
It's not like I have a choice.

592
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

593
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,990
Choices.

594
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,650
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

595
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,790
That's what this is all about,
the yesses and nos of life.

596
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,110
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

597
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,949
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

598
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,230
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

599
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,810
I get rid of the morphine.

600
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,400
And the pain I've been holding
in comes rushing out.

601
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,199
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

602
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,230
but like Vera said, no one on
the streets deals Suboxone.

603
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,819
I could go back to digitally
counterfeiting scripts,

604
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,620
but pharmas spend a lot of
dough protecting their wares.

605
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,990
Most places only take paper scripts.

606
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,799
Continuously getting legit
refills isn't realistic,

607
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,490
and neither is being a junkie.

608
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,830
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

609
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,750
I know what you're thinking.
The answer's too obvious.

610
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,100
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

611
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,640
but he's graduated to rape.

612
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,530
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

613
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,470
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

614
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,450
Perhaps we should start
with how you're feeling.

615
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Not good.

616
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
What's not good right now?

617
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,610
Everything.

618
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,880
Humor me with some specifics.

619
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,380
How do we know if we're in control?

620
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,059
That we're not just making the best

621
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,300
of what comes at us, and that's it.

622
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,520
Trying to constantly pick
between two options.

623
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,340
Like your two paintings
in the waiting room.

624
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,520
Or... Coke and Pepsi.

625
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
McDonald's or Burger King?

626
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,680
Hyundai or Honda?

627
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,640
It's all part of the same blur, right?

628
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,970
Just out of focus enough.

629
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
It's the illusion of choice.

630
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,980
Half of us can't even pick our own...

631
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,910
our cable, gas, electric.

632
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,240
The water we drink, our health insurance.

633
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,630
Even if we did, would it matter?

634
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,400
You know, if our only option
is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

635
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,820
what the f... is the difference?

636
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,270
In fact, aren't they...
aren't they the same?

637
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
No, man...

638
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,220
our choices are prepaid for us,

639
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,160
long time ago.

640
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

641
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,990
Thought I was doing something good.

642
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,160
I was a part of this... project.

643
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,830
Thought I was going to be a
part of something special.

644
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,790
And now?

645
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Now...

646
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
It turned out to be a mistake,

647
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,610
like everything else.

648
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,100
What's the point, right?

649
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,720
Might as well, just... you do nothing.

650
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,350
Might as well do nothing.

651
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,190
You've brought up this issue before,

652
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,559
this issue of not feeling
like you're in control.

653
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,610
Do you remember?

654
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,960
When we spoke about your father.

655
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,550
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

656
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,500
when he was battling his cancer.

657
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,539
You told him he could have fought
the company that caused it.

658
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,510
He could have told people about it.

659
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,070
He could have sought better
care than what he was getting.

660
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,530
Instead, he did nothing.

661
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,770
Maybe your father felt the
same way as you do now.

662
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,870
After all, like you said, what's the point?

663
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,630
- It's different. - What's different

664
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,110
is you've found options, Elliot.

665
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,509
That's the power you have.
That's the control you own.

666
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,380
You don't have to just
take what life gives you.

667
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Come on.

668
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,439
Tell me what is going on with you.

669
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,069
I cannot help you if you
keep me in the dark.

670
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,100
Shut up!

671
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,080
Shut up!

672
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,790
You've got bags under your eyes.

673
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,779
You're yelling. You're jittery.

674
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,819
For the last month, I have seen you

675
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,750
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

676
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,010
What is going on?

677
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
He's still not answering.

678
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,620
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

679
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,379
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

680
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,900
it just freezes up my computer
and spits it back out again.

681
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,290
He's not okay.

682
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,130
He was acting so out of it at work today.

683
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,230
Are you saying something, babe?

684
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,470
Something's wrong.

685
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,440
Should I go over there?

686
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
And just...

687
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,270
Check in on him?

688
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,420
Uh... come on.

689
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,220
That's ridiculous.

690
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,919
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

691
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm really worried about him.

692
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,110
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

693
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,600
He wants to grab a drink.

694
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,780
Shouldn't take too long.

695
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Okay.

696
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,120
"Deep passions, longing...

697
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,540
the two of them had never felt such a love,

698
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
such closeness, such a connection."

699
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,040
Found a way to do it without...

700
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Sit down.

701
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,509
I know how to take out the backups

702
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,039
without blowing up the pipeline.

703
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,979
You know, Elliot, I really
feel like we resolved

704
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,550
this thing between us.
Didn't you walk away?

705
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,730
I did.

706
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,429
Didn't I say that if you walked away,

707
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,900
you were no longer a part of this?

708
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,259
I have a real plan...

709
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,319
If you want me to let you back in,

710
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,270
there's an understanding
we have to come to,

711
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,239
a debt you have to pay,

712
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,230
because, remember, you walked away.

713
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,809
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

714
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,270
Not true. I believe in debts.

715
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,810
I believe in erasing them.

716
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,590
What do you want?

717
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,310
I want you to tell me about your father.

718
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,639
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

719
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,739
Your David Koresh shit
isn't gonna work on me.

720
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,070
Tell me how he died.

721
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,669
Why, man? Something tells me

722
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,439
you already looked that shit up anyway.

723
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,680
I wanna hear it from you.

724
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,680
So I do this...

725
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,089
we go back to the arcade,

726
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,930
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

727
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,340
I don't know what you want me to say.

728
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,599
We were close. Very close.

729
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,900
He was my best friend.

730
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,070
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

731
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,930
He was one of the best
computer engineers they had.

732
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,889
And out of the blue, he got fired.

733
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,980
No one knew why.

734
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,670
Then one day he told me.

735
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,630
He had leukemia.

736
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,750
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

737
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,200
especially my mom.

738
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,690
So I didn't.

739
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,760
A few months go by...

740
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,030
he got sicker and sicker.

741
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,920
Finally, I got so worried...

742
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,180
told my mom.

743
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,880
When he found out, he got pissed.

744
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,680
Started yelling.

745
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
I remember I tried to hug him,
tell him I'm sorry, and...

746
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,350
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

747
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,610
I fell backwards out the window.

748
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
I fell, and I broke my arm.

749
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,560
Never spoke to me after that.

750
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,100
Couldn't even look at me.

751
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,240
Even the night he died.

752
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,650
We good?

753
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,490
I understand what it's
like to lose a parent.

754
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,210
It's heartbreaking.

755
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,600
Did you ever think he was right?

756
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,340
About what?

757
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,210
Hurting you that day?

758
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,290
For what you did to him?

759
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,050
You ever think you deserved it?

760
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,209
I didn't do anything to him.

761
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,629
I was trying to help him.

762
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,100
For betraying his trust.

763
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,430
I was eight years old.

764
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,710
You didn't commit
to the sacred pact you'd formed.
