1
00:00:01,514 --> 00:00:04,139
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,000
Who told you to put your business
anywhere near social media?

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,224
My aspirational little brother.

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,677
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,414
- What happened to Angela?
- She's not gonna work out for us.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,530
Not on this level.

7
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,352
You didn't have to
stick up for me in there.

8
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:18,479
Don't do it again.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,204
Evil Corp tapped you for CTO, yes?

10
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:24,873
- You're ruining your life.
- I also ruined yours.

11
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:27,709
Terry Colby was involved in the cover up

12
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:31,028
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,816
Sharon, how do you not blow
your brains out, married to him?

14
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm in here.

15
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,288
Do you mind sleeping here tonight?

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,593
That girl in there is mine.

17
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,140
If you're around tonight,
come over and tell me about it.

18
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,466
Shayla?

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,368
Sometimes
the universe aligns perfectly.

20
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:55,270
Here I am, locked away,

21
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,439
still it brings you right to me.

22
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,650
I feel the sensation.

23
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:09,885
Fight or flight.

24
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,420
It's constant.

25
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,422
I should just pick one.

26
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:18,660
I, Elliot Alderson, am flight.

27
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:19,961
I am fear.

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,165
I am anxiety, terror, panic.

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,817
Doesn't feel real.

30
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:52,194
- You should eat.
- Not hungry.

31
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:54,946
I don't know what I ordered.

32
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,901
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:13,235
- You don't like the guisado?
- No, it's good.

34
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,583
Thank you.

35
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:32,802
- What are you thinking about?
- First time we met.

36
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:39,541
Doesn't feel that long ago.

37
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,077
Now look at us.

38
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,113
Who would have thought?

39
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,974
- If I could go back and undo this...
- You can't.

40
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,991
You promised me.

41
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,235
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?

42
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,861
Time's up.

43
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,062
Let's go.

44
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,197
Elliot!

45
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,842
Sit down. Sit down.

46
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:15,109
Come with me.

47
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:19,146
Let's go.

48
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,444
- Hello?
- The origin of your name.

49
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:51,255
I looked it up for you, bruh.

50
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:57,652
- Where are you taking her?
- Elliot. "Brave and true."

51
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:01,718
Did you know the origin of
"brave" evolved from "savage?

52
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,460
I don't know what this is about,
but you need to let her go.

53
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,997
You know, funny thing.
My name means something similar.

54
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:12,300
Brave traveler.
Adventurer.

55
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,304
Savage traveler becomes brave traveler.

56
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,775
Are we savages, or are we brave?

57
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,110
Don't know, bro.

58
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,814
Listen to me, man.

59
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,584
When I found out you did
this, I didn't get angry.

60
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,454
I got impressed.

61
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,122
Your power.

62
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,690
I want it, Elliot.

63
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,026
And I want it so bad it makes my dick hard.

64
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,528
And I want it today.

65
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:44,532
I don't know what you think I can do.
I can't just hack you out of prison.

66
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,635
Not all prisons are networked,
and even if yours is,

67
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,171
it would take weeks to find security holes.

68
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,006
Has to be tonight.

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,975
I got crosshairs on my heart.

70
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,643
I don't make it out,

71
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm dead, and that ain't
meant to be just yet.

72
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,648
You do your thing, bro.

73
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,017
You're asking the impossible.

74
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,856
When we cross paths tonight,
Elliot, I'ma hug you.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,891
Please listen, man.

76
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,661
Shayla... this is on me.
Okay?

77
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:16,831
- You got to let her go.
- Oh, that?

78
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:20,301
She cool, bro.
Trust me, she cool.

79
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:24,546
She'll be there tonight too.
It'll be one big happy happy.

80
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,913
Hey, Elliot.
I love you, bro.

81
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,157
- Where's Shayla?
- Man, I'm not gonna tell you again.

82
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:58,239
Stop asking so many questions.

83
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,275
Come on.

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,581
Vera may be out of his mind,

85
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:10,218
but yes, it is possible to
hack into a prison's network.

86
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:14,189
Most of them use regular
industrial control systems.

87
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,596
I'm a blind man to what
Vera sees in this dude.

88
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:23,198
Amen. Techie computer hacker
genius, my thick Dominican dick.

89
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,535
When you have control of that,

90
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,570
you basically have
control of the cell doors.

91
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,477
But what these morons don't know is,

92
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,980
it's almost impossible
without any research.

93
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:42,383
Time to shine your cojones and get to work.

94
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,820
Do what we say.

95
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,457
You violate that dictate,
we kill your sweetheart.

96
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,892
Yo, Isaac.

97
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,738
- How my dic-Tate?
- Shut up, bitch.

98
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:57,499
Dictate.

99
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,007
Vera's bro, Isaac.

100
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,176
Something about him bugs me,

101
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,179
and you know what I like
to do when that happens?

102
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:52,120
Hi, I'm trying to reach Mr. Beckett.

103
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,188
When would Mr. Lattimer be available?

104
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,790
I can come in today.

105
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:59,060
I already told you what
it's in reference to.

106
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:02,130
I'm trying again for Mrs. Nayar.

107
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,732
Regarding the Washington Township scandal.

108
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,634
I may have found some information.

109
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,237
Please don't put me on hold again.

110
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:26,353
Happy Monday, Angela.

111
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,856
How fun.

112
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:33,194
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,803
I'm Emily Moss's daughter.

114
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,339
Angela Moss.

115
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,474
- I called...
- Six times.

116
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,042
Yes.

117
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:25,079
I'm here to discuss the
Washington Township case.

118
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,752
I'm listening.

119
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,720
You represented the victim's families.

120
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,156
26 families, mine included.

121
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,558
I thought with the latest
news in the data dumps...

122
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,260
the Terry Colby scandal,

123
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,158
his covering up the chemical waste spill.

124
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,930
Alleged.

125
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,934
- Well, and documents.
- Superficial.

126
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:51,172
But if we bring this
stronger, more concrete case...

127
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,142
you'll see that I have the
evidence from the data dumps.

128
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,445
- Along with further research.
- Stickies.

129
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,181
Oh, and you've highlighted and underlined.

130
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,217
This is serious.

131
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,824
So, you want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

132
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:12,193
and throw it at the strongest conglomerate

133
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,362
in the history of civilization?

134
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,510
Guy in the suit.

135
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,815
Twice convicted of sexual assault,
charged again this past weekend.

136
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,450
Raped his pregnant girlfriend.

137
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,485
Bashed her head in with an Xbox.

138
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,188
Claims she cheated during Halo.

139
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,224
Yet I have a better
chance of defending him.

140
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,706
You called back.

141
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,778
I called every lawyer from this case, and
you're the only one that called me back.

142
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:02,559
Shit. Shit, shit.

143
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,565
Connection
closed by remote host.

144
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:11,801
But we had a fish. I was in.

145
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:15,472
The exploit started to run,
and then... was it the code?

146
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:18,141
Brah, what's the deal?

147
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:27,917
- I got to take her for a walk.
- Why?

148
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,414
'Cause she'll piss on the floor if I don't.

149
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,689
You think I've a shit
about your goddamn floor?

150
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,898
I'm just playing, brah.

151
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:46,503
Yeah, you can take her.

152
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:47,937
You hear what I said?

153
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:51,407
I said you can take her.

154
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,619
Come on.

155
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:17,767
- It's out.
- Okay, got you.

156
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,623
Did she like my little toy?

157
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:45,128
- Did you write that exploit yourself?
- I had an hour.

158
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,764
So what, you just pulled code
from rapid nine or some shit?

159
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:50,600
Since when did you become a script kiddie?

160
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,469
I repeat, I had an hour.

161
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:56,306
Malware detection must have caught it.

162
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,409
- You fucked me.
- Hey, don't put this on me, okay?

163
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:00,810
Th is a shit show

164
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,779
and you gave me no time to do it right.

165
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:08,585
I can run circles around an ICS given
the proper whitepapers and time.

166
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:11,570
- Where the hell are you going?
- I have no problem telling

167
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,585
these two douchetools they're
gonna have to sit on their pricks

168
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,325
till we can find a better solution.

169
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,789
- You don't understand. These guys are...
- Assholes?

170
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,830
Yeah, I'm gonna tell them what's up.

171
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,767
That's what's up, girl.

172
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,637
Now, let's go.

173
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:41,451
So none of those guys called
you back, not even Lattimer?

174
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,186
Pussies.

175
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,988
I bet they didn't even
bother to read the data dumps.

176
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,557
But you read them.

177
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,459
You know it took me eight years

178
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:53,129
to rebuild my career after
our case was dismissed?

179
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:58,701
So, as much as I think is
company is evil incarnate...

180
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:01,004
and trust me, they are...

181
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,339
You know, it's not worth it.

182
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,513
What would it take,

183
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:13,449
hypothetically...

184
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:18,554
- What do we need to prove our case?
- Hypothetically, a reliable eye witness...

185
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:21,610
You know, if you miraculously
find someone on the inside to flip.

186
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,974
Someone who was there

187
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:29,065
when the decision was may to
falsify chemical waste and tells...

188
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:34,904
So, unless you're Facebook friends
with one of those assholes,

189
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:38,474
this hypothetical is just that.

190
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,679
Let's move on.

191
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:45,415
Where are you working these?

192
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,083
You have a boyfriend?

193
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,953
How's your dad?

194
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:53,456
I work for a company
that doesn't respect me,

195
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,225
my boyfriend recently cheated on me,

196
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,663
and my father is drowning in debt.

197
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:10,353
- I'll see you next time.
- Okay.

198
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:19,628
Fluorescent lights are hell, no?

199
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,465
Was there a change in schedule?

200
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,435
I thought I had Spencer next.

201
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:30,423
These interviews, they're
just a waste of your time.

202
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,276
I mean, you know our regulatory
and IP issues inside out.

203
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:36,703
I was thinking we play
hooky the rest of the day,

204
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:41,223
hit the back nine.

205
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,375
- Is that a Vacheron?
- Patek Philippe Tourbillon.

206
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:50,559
A gift from the Prince of, uh...

207
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,860
Oh, does it even matter?

208
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:05,007
But I'm not blowing off
my remaining interviews.

209
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,809
Look.

210
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:12,147
I know you think you
were a shoo-in for CTO,

211
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,950
and you're pissed.

212
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:19,154
Probably wishing I'd fall
into the subway tracks.

213
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,859
So how about you cut the bullshit?

214
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,995
I'm afraid your paranoia has
gotten the best of you, but,

215
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,054
nevertheless, please excuse me.

216
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,466
I'll leave you to review your notes

217
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,954
before Spencer arrives.

218
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:36,339
Oh, and thank you for dinner.

219
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,707
The entire evening was enchanting.

220
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:41,449
The food, the wine, the lovely Sharon.

221
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,607
Please tell her I say hello.

222
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:50,407
Did you enjoy the view?

223
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:57,120
What?

224
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:03,950
- Do you think she wouldn't tell me?
- I'm not sure what you're trying...

225
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:06,123
You want to watch me piss too?

226
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:09,114
- I've had several glasses of water.
- Scott, a misunderstand...

227
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:12,429
Happy to pull my dick out
for you, if that's your thing.

228
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,726
Watching the Knowles family urinate.

229
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:19,636
Hell, I could fly my brother in from Miami.

230
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:22,139
He has the bladder of a small child.

231
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,585
You'd probably bust a nut
watching him take a leak.

232
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,677
I'm not sure what she told
you, but if I were you,

233
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,913
I would tell her to find
more appropriate ways

234
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:33,117
of managing her imagination.

235
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,918
Tyrell.

236
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,499
I want you to accept a hard truth,

237
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,324
right here, right now, in front of me.

238
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:44,361
You are not going to be CTO.

239
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:51,001
I want to see that look
wash over your face.

240
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:54,838
It's the only way I know
you'll stop playing these

241
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:59,049
silly, silly games.

242
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,447
Oh, I am fully aware you're CTO, Scott.

243
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:08,485
I'm not sure what more I can offer you.

244
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,155
Wait.

245
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:13,590
Here.

246
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,693
I feel bad.

247
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:19,029
After all, you got a child on the way.

248
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:20,230
You need all the help you can get.

249
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,732
In fact,

250
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:25,369
this would probably pay off
the rest of your mortgage.

251
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:30,407
Aren't you still in that neat
little two bedroom in Chelsea?

252
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:36,013
There.

253
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,885
That's the look I was looking for.

254
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:55,947
I keep brute force
thinking, but it's not working.

255
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,368
I need help.

256
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:14,652
- Elliot, you in there?
- Shit.

257
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,253
Why is she here?

258
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:18,989
Elliot!

259
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,563
Let me in.

260
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:29,500
Elliot, you in there?

261
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,235
Little blonde bitty.

262
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,043
Elliot, hit the buzzer.

263
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,748
- I know you're in there.
- Go.

264
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:40,783
Shut her up, and get
her the hell out of here.

265
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:44,053
Elliot. Buzzer. Now.

266
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,987
- What about Darlene?
- She stays with us.

267
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:51,260
And we'll be watching you, so don't bother
trying any dumb shit, you dumb shit.

268
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,100
Fuck!

269
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:13,882
Do you understand why you're angry?

270
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,886
'Cause you know I'm right.

271
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,811
I tried looking for you after
Gideon's the other night.

273
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:36,126
- Where were you?
- I had to think about things, you know?

274
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,390
We always knew what Evil Corp did.

275
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:44,825
We didn't have the proof,

276
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,329
but we knew.

277
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:50,064
We were right about it all along.

278
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:53,667
In fact, that news report
wasn't a confirmation.

279
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:57,738
It was a reminder of how angry I am.

280
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,714
You remember Nayar, the lawyer on the case?

281
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:10,317
- I went to her, Elliot.
- Listen, Angela, now's not...

282
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:15,322
I have an idea that will change the world.

283
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:17,146
I know it sounds really stupid,

284
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:21,529
but I know how to do it.

285
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:28,069
I think it could actually work.

286
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:30,954
- I can't tell you what it is, because...
- Evil Corp, Angela,

287
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:33,507
Vera, his brother, Darlene, Shayla.

288
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,276
This is too much.

289
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,179
I should just tell her
what she wants to hear.

290
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:43,184
Angela, trust yourself.

291
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:45,386
You'll do what's right.

292
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:56,697
That's all I needed.

293
00:23:56,731 --> 00:24:01,223
- How's Shayla, by the way?
- She's...

294
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:08,299
- you know.
- Tell her I say hi.

295
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:21,555
Have no time to pull off

296
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,017
- whatever it is you think you're doing.
- What are you doing here?

297
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:25,611
- How did you know?
- Darlene.

298
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:27,077
These guys aren't playing around.

299
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,080
They will fucking kill you.

300
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:31,965
- Now wise up, and let's go.
- Darlene's in there. We can't leave.

301
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:37,071
Okay, then we call the cops.

302
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,239
There's no other choice here.

303
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,941
- It's the only way out of this.
- I can't call the cops.

304
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,157
- Shayla will die.
- Oh, come on.

305
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,246
She knew exactly what she
was getting herself into.

306
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,248
You think his employees
have a long life expectancy?

307
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,616
She was dead the minute

308
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,878
- she started working with that maniac.
- Forget it. It's not happening.

309
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,488
This is a zero-sum game.

310
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:56,524
Calculate all the outcomes.

311
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,492
If you don't pull off
this ridiculous miracle...

312
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,982
and odds are, you won't...
you die, and so does Shayla.

313
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,163
That much we know.

314
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:03,697
But assume for a second

315
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,599
that you do pull this off,
bust Vera out of prison.

316
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:08,269
Who's to say he doesn't
kill you, Shayla, Darlene?

317
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,638
It would be in his own
best interest to do that.

318
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,673
Either way, you all end up dead.

319
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,842
It's the only way Vera wins.

320
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:16,477
Zero-sum, Elliot.

321
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:18,112
You're playing a game you already lost.

322
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:22,516
- You know I'm right.
- There's got to be a way.

323
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:27,221
- I can think of a way.
- I get it, kiddo.

324
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:30,057
You want to help people. Watch over 'em.

325
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:32,560
The best thing you
can do for Shayla...

326
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:37,476
- allow her to become a memory.
- No.

327
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:44,038
True courage is about
being honest with yourself.

328
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:47,007
Especially when it's difficult.

329
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:52,880
There is no plan where
both you and Shayla survive.

330
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:54,882
I can think of a way.

331
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:59,053
This new world that we are so
close to creating will never be.

332
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:00,724
And that new world, that is success.

333
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:03,257
Fsociety is success.

334
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,992
Look at what you accomplished
at Steel Mountain.

335
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:07,695
- That got us nowhere.
- You took them down.

336
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:09,830
You won that battle.

337
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:13,267
This... this is failure.

338
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,502
This is the old Elliot.

339
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:18,939
The one who turns to morphine,
to drugs when he feels weak.

340
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:21,208
A coward who can't face the truth,

341
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:26,080
even though it's staring
him right in the face.

342
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:28,082
There's that sensation again.

343
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:29,883
Fight or flight.

344
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:33,120
Three lives at stake, including my own.

345
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:37,758
I, Elliot Alderson, am...

346
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,260
what?

347
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:46,066
Tom Petty, Pink Floyd,
Van Halen? What's up, man?

348
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,535
You ain't got no Drake,
no Pitbull, no nothing?

349
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,437
Like, what's up? What the fuck?

350
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:58,608
- What's up, Rain Man?
- I'm ready to bust Vera out.

351
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,814
I can get into the network.

352
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,383
We need to go to the jail.

353
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,222
Now.

354
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:07,821
- She stays here.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

355
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:12,509
Don't worry, he's in no position
to be giving out orders.

356
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:17,831
Let's go, girl.

357
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:21,468
Remember when the panic would
set in and we had a solution?

358
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:23,737
To be honest, I miss that.

359
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:28,676
Life is so much easier when you're numb.

360
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,137
- What's the plan, bitch boy?
- First Shayla, now Darlene.

361
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:39,257
- Yo, what the fuck?
- Elliot, what are you doing?

362
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,123
Like a hard
drive blasted by excessive voltage,

363
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:44,191
my mind is frayed.

364
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,260
Close to fried.

365
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:49,029
I can feel the static
running through my brain.

366
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:51,665
Serotonin receptors working overtime.

367
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,534
I need more time.

368
00:27:57,172 --> 00:28:02,343
- Tonight, tonight, tonight.
- More time right now.

369
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:04,311
I'm working on our project as we speak,

370
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,648
so it's in your best interest
to keep talking with me.

371
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:09,516
At the
security desk, my cell phone

372
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:12,019
is running an undetectable
activated signal sniffer

373
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:15,522
that will locate any kind
of wireless signal in sight.

374
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,791
By the time I leave this building,

375
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,794
I'll own its network.

376
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,796
Good on you.

377
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:28,168
Brave, but stupid.

378
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:32,239
You showed your face, and
then I skip out tonight.

379
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:35,342
- Who do you think they're gonna finger?
- I'm opening every cell.

380
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,578
That way, they can't
trace it back to you or me.

381
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:42,115
Yeah, bro.

382
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:45,753
That's what I'm talking about.

383
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:49,990
I told you, didn't I?

384
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:54,328
- The universe got big plans for us, bro.
- Sit back down.

385
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:06,707
When you get out, I realize
you're gonna have to split.

386
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:10,244
You won't be able to stay
in the tri-state area.

387
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:11,578
Oh, I love this.

388
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,447
Go on.

389
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:16,450
Wherever you go, you're gonna
need funding to keep surviving.

390
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:19,720
Which means your whole operation still
needs to be making you money.

391
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:23,805
- Come on, Elliot. Give it to me.
- I hacked Isaac's phone.

392
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:30,139
He had everything. Your crew,
shipments, the entire operation.

393
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,367
I took it all. I own your whole world.

394
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:40,707
I need your word.

395
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:43,911
When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.

396
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:47,047
You leave us alone.
Forever.

397
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,816
If anyone tries to hurt us,

398
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,254
if I even see one of your guys
following me, I leak everything.

399
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:57,707
- You're saying this knowing...
- You can kill me anytime, yes.

400
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:04,398
That's why I coded the leak to auto-send every
24 hours unless I continuously disable it.

401
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,433
No one else has access.

402
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:12,739
If anything happens to me or Shayla,
your money gets deleted.

403
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,512
Guns up, Vera, let's go.

404
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:29,957
Remember. I'ma hug you.

405
00:30:54,645 --> 00:31:00,371
- So what's your deal?
- I'm hear to see Terry Colby.

406
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:09,025
Who is that, another damn reporter?

407
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,994
No comment. Do you understand?

408
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,567
Do I know you?

409
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:25,275
Get the hell away from my home.

410
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,277
Get away from my home.

411
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:36,119
WPA2 Wi-Fi?

412
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,120
Shit.

413
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:38,955
Borderline unhackable.

414
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:41,491
Getting that handshake could take days.

415
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,793
The noose is tightening.

416
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:05,982
The mobile feed on the cameras.

417
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:09,786
I don't need to hack WPA2
when there's dedicated 4G.

418
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:26,488
- We're good.
- I can pull this off.

419
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,706
- Get in.
- Let's go, girl.

420
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,775
Nah, just him.

421
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,044
- Yo, Isaac, what you doing...
- Nah, bro, it's fine.

422
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,614
I just want to have a
private chat with him.

423
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,382
Come on, it's cool.

424
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,950
We don't have any time, man.

425
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:44,787
- I got to get to work.
- Get the fucking in the car.

426
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,330
- Yo man, where you going, what you doing?
- All good, all good.

427
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:56,195
- Just gonna have a talk.
- Are you doing?

428
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:11,581
Why are you doing this?

429
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,582
I can free your brother.

430
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,752
- I figured it out.
- It just wasn't your day, bruh.

431
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,409
I hacked your whole operation.

432
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,103
- If you kill me...
- You don't get it.

433
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,692
Like I said, it just wasn't your day.

434
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:27,397
Stop.

435
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:35,004
I suppose
a bullet through the brain

436
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,106
is peaceful in its own right.

437
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:49,218
You don't want me to free Vera.

438
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,387
That's why you don't
care about the operation.

439
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:55,332
- I'd pick better last words.
- You're trying to kill him.

440
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,361
That's why Vera wants to leave tonight.

441
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:00,596
That's what's been bugging me about you.

442
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,966
You never wanted me to break him out.

443
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,468
Your best option for survival
is to kill him in prison,

444
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,602
because if you don't,

445
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:09,272
you're dead.

446
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:11,140
You're the reason Vera's
locked up right now,

447
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,643
and he knows it.

448
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,478
Doesn't matter anyway.

449
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,716
Vera was just gloating about how
he got in with the right crew,

450
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,986
how he got the jump on some men.

451
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,287
He's not worried, man.

452
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:27,092
- He's protected now.
- Bullshit.

453
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,280
That leaves
you with a zero-sum game.

454
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,695
If you don't get him out of jail,
he'll have you killed for failing.

455
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:36,933
Only way this works in your favor
is for you to kill him first,

456
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:39,202
and you can't do that
with him inside anymore.

457
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:40,703
Shut up, motherfucker.

458
00:34:40,737 --> 00:34:45,125
- Shut the fuck up.
- Let me free him.

459
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:49,912
When I break Vera out tonight,

460
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:52,715
you do with your brother what you want.

461
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:54,183
That's the only outcome

462
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:58,054
where you got the possibility of living.

463
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,191
It's your best move.

464
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:05,261
What makes you think I still
won't kill you afterwards?

465
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,034
I don't.

466
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,597
I'm just playing my best move.

467
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:43,682
I need 30 to 40
seconds with the patrol car's

468
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,491
Bluetooth connection to
run the exploit on the PLC.

469
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:52,629
- And then?
- The plan executes at 9:49.

470
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,364
All the cell doors should open.

471
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:59,603
Hey, I wanted to ask you about something.

472
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,272
- Oh, yeah, what's that?
- You.

473
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,499
Give me a call.

474
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:34,070
- We'll grab a drink, talk, whatever.
- All right.

475
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:43,446
The exploit's on his laptop.

476
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:52,022
Now I need to force-feed
it into the jail's network.

477
00:36:56,891 --> 00:36:58,662
I like what I hear.

478
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:07,237
- I paused the exploit.
- Drive.

479
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:09,539
Darlene's no longer part of the plan.

480
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,576
We got an alarm
going off, east-side exit.

481
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:18,615
- What in the hell?
- Tell you what.

482
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:20,750
We go out, we drink, we dance,

483
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,352
see where the night takes us.

484
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,377
You sure you want to make

485
00:37:23,378 --> 00:37:26,681
- that choice right now?
- I only need to press one key

486
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,959
to run the exploit. Or, I can press
another and disable the entire plan.

487
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,996
I made my move.

488
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,234
You make yours.

489
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,742
Shit.

490
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:47,244
Please move back, miss.

491
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,813
- I got to get back ASAP.
- Whatever.

492
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:02,359
Look, I got to come back now.
My computer's on the fritz.

493
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,129
Let's go to the meet, DJ.

494
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:09,099
If I mis-typed
one command, hit one wrong key,

495
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,101
the cell doors won't open.

496
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:13,503
And we both know what that means.

497
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:15,505
Did I make a mistake?

498
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,541
No, I don't make mistakes.

499
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,348
One minute till Vera.

500
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,118
For all his insane, inhumane ideas,

501
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,820
he does understand the world.

502
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:33,590
The wild savagery of the world.

503
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:43,677
- What you need your piece for, bro?
- Boy Wonder says

504
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:46,925
he's opening all the cells.
If some fool tries to rush us,

505
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:50,325
I want to be ready.

506
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:12,168
- Hey, what the shit?
- Power surge caused by all the cell doors

507
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,682
opening at the same time.

508
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,727
- What about security? Sirens?
- The jail's network will show

509
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:20,528
all cells locked and closed.
Alarms are silent for two minutes.

510
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:01,396
Yes. Yes.

511
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,231
This shit right here,

512
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:07,269
this shit tastes better
than any pussy I ever had.

513
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,053
DJ, shoot the cocksucker.

514
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:42,971
My own brother.

515
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:46,708
That's what the universe asked of me.

516
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:49,878
To be my brother's keeper.

517
00:40:49,912 --> 00:40:51,713
Like Cain after Abel,

518
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:55,717
I'll be a fugitive and
wanderer on the earth.

519
00:40:55,952 --> 00:41:00,088
Brave fugitive.

520
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:03,191
Brave wanderer.

521
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,061
Look how you helped me.

522
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:09,030
That's the kind of bravery
I've been talking about.

523
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,500
But now...

524
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:16,238
now I want you to look at Isaac.

525
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:18,773
Look.

526
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,348
Dead proof.

527
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,416
My operation is over.

528
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,118
So go on, crash it.

529
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:31,786
Burn it to the ground.

530
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,955
Doesn't matter.

531
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,525
I'm gone.

532
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,294
A spirit.

533
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,297
One with all the heavens.

534
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,132
All existence.

535
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,741
Shayla.

536
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:57,646
- Where is she?
- Keys, yo.

537
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,650
Told you you'd get her back, bro.

538
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:06,355
You just didn't realize she
was with you the whole time.
