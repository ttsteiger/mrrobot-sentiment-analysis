1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,470
Steel Mountain. The hacker's dilemma.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,350
What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,140
is completely off the grid?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,620
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,130
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,010
Dark Army?

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,720
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,590
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,610
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,760
Please buy my CD.

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,390
He has my bank account, Ollie.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,200
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,180
Can we please hear the plan?

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,950
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,310
I know how to take out the backups without blowing up the pipeline.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,410
What do normal people do when they get this sad?

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,500
They reach out to friends or family.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
I do morphine.

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,720
There it is.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,530
After all the searching, scraping, dusting,

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,130
That's all that's left.

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,970
One line. The last line.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,490
The consequences of busting Vera and meeting Mr. Robot,

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,840
creating you--everything till now, this moment.

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,700
I chose this. I chose all this.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,040
Data storage facilities like Steel Mountain--

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,500
it's linear-tape open standard 9.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,370
Temp value between 61 and 95.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,080
Iron oxide in mag tape--

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,160
it sticks to polyurethane with a binder.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,070
If hvac conditions surpass the ceiling 95 degrees,

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,000
polyurethane adhesive mollifies and tape data is unreadable.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,650
This is what we're doing.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,520
This circuit board, if installed behind a thermostat,

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,980
it lets us plant an asymmetric back door

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,570
then create a VPN in the Steel Mountain intranet.

37
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,500
Okay, we all know what a Raspberry Pi is.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,730
What's your point?

39
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,040
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system,

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,830
raise the facility's heat high enough

41
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,940
to destroy all the tapes.

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,450
And you think sticking this behind the thermostat

43
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,740
will do all that?

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,040
With the right software specifically designed.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,900
I'll pull up my research on the facility,

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,870
start targeting which thermostats are the most accessible.

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,150
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,610
but we still gotta get in the damn joint.

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,740
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

50
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,140
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,690
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

52
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,830
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

53
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,330
Sure you don't want to just blow it up?

54
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,280
All we need is one security flaw.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,180
Look at this place, man. It was built not to have any.

56
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,670
I see about... six walking around.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,760
You okay, man?

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,760
What the hell?

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,270
Where you going?

60
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,880
We're done, aren't we?

61
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,870
That was about the time the withdrawal started.

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,200
Remember?

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,950
I know--I broke my own rule.

64
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,900
But I have no suboxone.

65
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,210
What I do have--clinical depression, social anxiety.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,750
A day job, a night job, confusing relationships.

67
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,320
Others depending on me.

68
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,680
Taking down the largest corporation in the world.

69
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,630
And I chose it all.

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,700
This line has wanted to own me my whole life.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,630
Biosynthesized in some lab in Mexico, packed into a pill,

72
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,590
shipped to the states where it was packaged

73
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,980
with a logo and taxed by the government,

74
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,710
stolen by a bribed guard, sold to a Vera henchman,

75
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,650
then oversold to Shayla, and then to me.

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,010
It needs me just as much as I need it.

77
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,770
The moment was destined, every choice bringing me

78
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,690
closer to this one line.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,010
This line. This last line.

80
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,870
I promise.

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,300
Today will be the worst of it.

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,070
Get through the next couple days, and then I'll be clean.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
What do you want?

84
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,210
It's me, open up.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,520
I would have saved you the trip to the door

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,580
but you're all, like, against me breaking in or whatever.

87
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,140
Why are you here?

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,280
Romero got some clarity on your little plan

89
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,980
that's gonna need your undivided.

90
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,720
- Okay, let's go. - What's going on with you?

91
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,990
You look like shit.

92
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,060
I'm fine.

93
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,520
Look, man. This plan's not gonna work.

94
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,660
Why? Why is that?

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
I was doing recon on Steel Mountain.

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,720
Came up with a problem. A big, fat one.

97
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,570
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

98
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,200
If you ask me, it's overkill, but it's legit.

99
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,430
I already told you, they have their vulnerabilities.

100
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,880
So what happens after we hack the New York facility?

101
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,740
Then we have to take a trip to Nashville,

102
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,940
then Colorado, then San Jose,

103
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,090
then goddamn Tallahassee.

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,470
Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad.

105
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,390
They are physically copying then shipping

106
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,260
all the analog backups.

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,150
Five big-ass fortress-like redundancies across the country.

108
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,130
Now maybe--and it was always a big maybe--

109
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,760
we get into one, but no way we get into all of them.

110
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,670
The minute we fry one facility,

111
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,420
they'll patch every climate control system they own.

112
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,380
No matter how you slice it, the plan is DOA.

113
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,630
Where'd you get this?

114
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,420
What the hell do you mean?

115
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,460
We're still in Evil Corp's network.

116
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,070
Shit.

117
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,780
This is what Tyrell was talking about.

118
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,130
What'd you just say? Tyrell?

119
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,820
As in Tyrell Wellick?

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,740
Yeah.

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,740
Since when did you and the goddamn CTO

122
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,440
of Evil Corp become, what, chums?

123
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,290
Says this isn't happening till April 1st.

124
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
It's only the 29th.

125
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,580
We still got a few days.

126
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,330
We have time.

127
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,230
All their tapes are still in the New York facility.

128
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,250
Just means we go up today.

129
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,370
We're nowhere close to being ready.

130
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Well, I've already downloaded all the necessary PDFs

131
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,320
of the floor plans to target the thermostats.

132
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,300
It will require some planning,

133
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,840
But nothing I can't do in the car.

134
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,130
It shouldn't take me long to own the facility's scada network.

135
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,610
Especially with some help.

136
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,510
You guys hit the road

137
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,420
while Trenton helps me finish the distro.

138
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,510
We'll double-time it.

139
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,220
You can get it off the FTP server as soon as you get there.

140
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,110
What about China?

141
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,260
We'd have to execute the hack before Tuesday.

142
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,150
Don't worry about China.

143
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,910
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Oh, you just gonna hit up

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,570
the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

146
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,240
Ya'll have gone and misplaced your collective minds.

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,260
We've been planning this for months.

148
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,810
Now we're gonna go up on a lark just 'cause he said so?

149
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,390
This plan is shit.

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
The plan will work.

151
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,060
And once we're actually there,

152
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,160
plus we have no idea who physically's gonna go in.

153
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,330
It's my plan. I'll go in.

154
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,930
Look, man, you...

155
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,990
You might be able to hide it from these nerds,

156
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,140
but I know a junkie when I see one.

157
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,860
In your condition, you ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

158
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,220
except puke your brains out

159
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,290
or give hand jobs for another high.

160
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,280
Like you said,

161
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
in three days, one Steel Mountain becomes five.

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,080
That's no good for any plan.

163
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,340
Something ain't right about this guy.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,460
Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far.

165
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,570
Still, I don't trust him.

166
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,730
Well, it's not about trust, remember?

167
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,040
Thank you, mom.

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,370
- There it is. - All right.

169
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,210
Come to daddy.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,530
Yo, man.

171
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
You gonna say anything about this?

172
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,800
What's there to say?

173
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,750
You seem to have everything under control.

174
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah. Okay.

175
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,590
This isn't my operation.

176
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,400
I told you before.

177
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,350
You're the key to the whole thing.

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,750
You're the only force of nature at play here.

179
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,740
There's a saying.

180
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,200
The devil's at his strongest

181
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
while we're looking the other way,

182
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,340
like a program running in the background silently,

183
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,460
while we're busy doing other shit.

184
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,890
Daemons, they call them.

185
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,140
They perform action without user interaction.

186
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,180
Monitoring, logging, notifications.

187
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,370
Primal urges,

188
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,680
repressed memories,

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
unconscious habits.

190
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,590
They're always there, always active.

191
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,690
We can try to be right,

192
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,480
we can try to be good,

193
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,420
we can try to make a difference,

194
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,170
but it's all bullshit.

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,530
'Cause intentions are irrelevant.

196
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,540
They don't drive us. Daemons do.

197
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,490
And me? I've got more than most.

198
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,050
I just need to rest a minute, okay? I'll be fine.

199
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,190
Bullshit--a couple hours,

200
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,080
you'll wish you felt as shitty as you do right now.

201
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,910
Wait till the convulsions start.

202
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,170
Full body pains, leaking from everywhere, then--

203
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,200
hypersensitivity to brightness and sound.

204
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,930
After that, overwhelming paranoia

205
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,200
followed by the darkest of depressions.

206
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,240
Symptoms may persist for two weeks,

207
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,290
assuming I last that long.

208
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,580
Yeah, I know what's in store.

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,610
Romero may have a point.

210
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,960
You're not gonna be good for anything till you kick this.

211
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,180
I...It burns.

212
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Don't be mad at me.

213
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,250
I know I slipped, but I'm about to change the world.

214
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm about to change the world.

215
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,050
Shit.

216
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,080
Mm, that is the way I like to get up in the morning.

217
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,270
Screw coffee or breakfast in bed.

218
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,700
The first thing I could see every day

219
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,280
is that sweet butt of yours.

220
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,430
I'd be the happiest dude in the city.

221
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,180
Are you going somewhere, babe?

222
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,140
Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch.

223
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,260
What? No, babe.

224
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,080
I was gonna take you to brunch.

225
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,960
I mean, I know that things are, like, okay

226
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,060
between us right now, but I'm--I'm not

227
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,690
gonna let myself off easy, all right?

228
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,340
You will be wined, and you will be dined

229
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,190
until I feel I've gotten myself out of the doghouse.

230
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,060
Well, we can do something tonight, then.

231
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,540
Perfect.

232
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,920
- Okay. - No.

233
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,950
Oh, hey.

234
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,060
Is Elliot around? I tried texting him.

235
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,740
Uh, he didn't text me back.

236
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,750
Yeah, he's gone for the day,

237
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,900
which is why I'm on Flipper duty.

238
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,780
Where is he?

239
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,930
Shit if I know.

240
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,400
I mean, I don't ask details,

241
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
but he only ever tells me what he wants anyway, right?

242
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120
And I'll tell him you stopped by.

243
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,750
Do you want to walk with us?

244
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,850
Flipper loves an audience when she pees.

245
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,100
Sure. Yeah. I gotta...

246
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,450
head back towards the subway anyway.

247
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,570
Oh, we don't plan our path.

248
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,750
I mean, we just kind of wing it and see where the moment takes us.

249
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,380
Come on.

250
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,680
Come on, before she bursts.

251
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,930
Maybe this was all intentional.

252
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,260
My subconscious, running in the background,

253
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,380
making me doubt what I got everyone else to believe in.

254
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,000
Turning me into the physical manifestation of my fear

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,590
of being a...

256
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,280
Goddamn waste.

257
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,670
Just give him a night to recover, okay?

258
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,980
- We still have tomorrow. - This shit'll last a week.

259
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,010
And I refuse to waste my time playing nurse.

260
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,530
We gotta get back, regroup, start devising a plan b.

261
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,590
The rabbit is in the administration system.

262
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,790
- Send a flu shot. - Rabbit, flu shot...

263
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,390
- Someone talk to me. - A rabbit replicates

264
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,730
till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.

265
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,620
Cancer?

266
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,920
Hollywood hacker bullshit.

267
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,690
I been in this game 27 years.

268
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,960
Not once have I ever come across an animated singing virus.

269
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,180
I have yet to fly through a Tron city directory structure.

270
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,300
I bet you right now some writer's working hard on a TV show

271
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,610
that'll mess up this generation's idea of hacker culture.

272
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,500
All you had to do is ask, klepto.

273
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,210
I've updated the FTP.

274
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,770
All the files are ready.

275
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,980
- I've created... - Any word from the road?

276
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,730
Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours.

277
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,600
Where the hell could they be?

278
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,360
Got any Advil?

279
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm guessing you didn't make contact.

280
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,170
Nope.

281
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,040
Perhaps this plan was a little too ambitious.

282
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
We'll wait until the rest of them get back

283
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,260
and then reevaluate.

284
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,360
Sitting here helpless while we crash and burn?

285
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,740
Not my speed.

286
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,040
Even if they hack into steel mountain,

287
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,740
we need to hit China's data centers simultaneously.

288
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,300
If the Dark Army isn't compliant,

289
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,010
then there's not much we can do.

290
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,390
God... Shit!

291
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,990
I got so wasted, I forgot it's Sunday.

292
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,420
I know where my guy will be.

293
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,090
Is that wise?

294
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,720
Those guys aren't known for being the most understanding.

295
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm assuming if he wanted contact--

296
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,830
What about what I want?

297
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,190
I'm coming with you.

298
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,050
No, thank you.

299
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,140
You stick around, wait for the boys to FTP it.

300
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,460
Hey, Trenton.

301
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,520
Here.

302
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,950
- What is this? - Come on, they're my last two.

303
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,790
Is this ecstasy?

304
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,280
No, it's clarity.

305
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,950
It'll help you see past whatever's bringing you down.

306
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

307
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,840
I...don't do drugs.

308
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,190
I mean, I-I smoke weed--

309
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,530
Well, sorry, but there's no take-backs, so...

310
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,300
Besides, don't you want to figure your shit out?

311
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,050
For me, sometimes when I'm going through something,

312
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,230
just gotta--I don't know.

313
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,610
Forget about it for a little while.

314
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,020
Are you seriously drinking a goddamn sparkling water right now?

315
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,970
If you weren't wearing my scarf, I'd kick your ass.

316
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,280
I think we should go.

317
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,290
Trust me--he's here every Sunday, okay?

318
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,880
He'll show.

319
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,180
Jesus Christ, Romero. What are we gonna do?

320
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,750
We dump him at a hospital,

321
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,890
come up with an alternative course of action.

322
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,350
That's our only option.

323
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,820
No. No hospital.

324
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,580
Then we split. Screw it.

325
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,360
I mean, you say it all the time yourself,

326
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,350
there's casualties in every revolution.

327
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,340
All that matters is the end result.

328
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
We got no time to haul dead weight.

329
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,520
Fine! You wanna leave, leave.

330
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,470
Screw this, man.

331
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,760
I need a hit.

332
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,310
I'll be better.

333
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,020
Just to get me through this.

334
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,380
I can't let you do that.

335
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,760
One hit.

336
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,660
You know, just to get me back on the road.

337
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,410
We don't have time. This...

338
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,270
needs to happen now.

339
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,740
One hit.

340
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,110
Come on.

341
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,370
Let's go.

342
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,030
Excuse me, fella.

343
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,790
You lookin' for something?

344
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,460
He could really use a helping hand.

345
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,120
Yeah, okay, he can go in. But only him.

346
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,480
Uh, no can do. I gotta come with.

347
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,910
Only if you're partaking, otherwise he goes it alone.

348
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,660
Here you go.

349
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,510
30.

350
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,230
30.

351
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,580
The guy in the house will set you up right.

352
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,450
Long as he doesn't kill you.

353
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,070
All right, look, the minute you're done...

354
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,710
you leave.

355
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,050
You don't look at anyone. You don't talk to anyone.

356
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,430
You take care of business and you get out.

357
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,940
Nod if you understand.

358
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,990
You want?

359
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,720
Big eyes.

360
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,400
It's all good, man. Go on.

361
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,480
I just...

362
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,780
I need morphine. Pills.

363
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,700
No, man.

364
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,930
This is all we got right here.

365
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,740
It's better.

366
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,520
Trust me.

367
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,800
Go on.

368
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,550
There you go. There you go.

369
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,360
I'll help.

370
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,500
It'll be okay. I'll help.

371
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,030
Have I sunk this low?

372
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,120
What must you think of me?

373
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,100
Is it spring? Election year?

374
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,670
Shall I hibernate?

375
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,390
Did we meet? In money we trust.

376
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,220
No, I created-- stop.

377
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,740
I can't control thoughts. I need this.

378
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,550
I know I promised my last line, but...

379
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,290
That's right.

380
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,400
Greedy bitch!

381
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,670
Shit, man--

382
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

383
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,570
here's that seven-day forecast for the tri-state area.

384
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,610
Lots of clouds today, but mostly sunny through Thursday

385
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,600
with temperatures in the mid to the upper 80s.

386
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,070
And you will notice that the humidity will be a tad uncomfortable.

387
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,560
Dear brothers and sisters,

388
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,980
now is the time to open your eyes.

389
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,390
If you have not yet woken up to the reality of

390
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,400
profiteering and enslavement we've been warning you about,

391
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,460
I hope you realize you are fast running out of time.

392
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,770
The governments of the world and their corporate masters

393
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,500
do not want us to speak.

394
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
Why? Because we unlock truths.

395
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,870
We expose villains. We exorcize demons.

396
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,490
Citizens of the world, we are here to help.

397
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,300
If you have any interest in waking from your slumber,

398
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,420
in retrieving lost, damaged, or stolen memory,

399
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,820
we are here for you.

400
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,740
We have your back. We are fsociety.

401
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
What's it open?

402
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,890
It belongs to you now.

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,510
Made in the orient.

404
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,780
Made just for your head.

405
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,220
Now, find your monster, then turn the key.

406
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,600
But first...

407
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,160
a word from our corporate overlords!

408
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,180
If you see our logo, that means you can rest assured

409
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,910
that you're buying the best food,

410
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,370
clothing, shelter,

411
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,780
transportation, hygiene, electronics,

412
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,680
and life's necessities that money can buy.

413
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,570
Hello.

414
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,290
Hello, friend.

415
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,830
But we're not friends.

416
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,120
Can you tell me what happened to that house?

417
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,500
First can you tell me? What's your monster?

418
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,070
I think you dropped this.

419
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,320
Don't be shy now.

420
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,300
You can come closer.

421
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,200
Unsettling, I know.

422
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,810
Your pet beta fish chatting you up.

423
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,140
But time's money, Elliot.

424
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,490
You need something?

425
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,530
Your water-- does it need changing?

426
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,380
When you live in a fishbowl, ain't no such thing as change.

427
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,680
My entire life's been spent in this thing.

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,510
My whole world's on your side table.

429
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,770
I look around-- same shit, different day.

430
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,850
The lighting, the furniture.

431
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,620
Even the sounds-- always the same.

432
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,980
I'm on a loop,

433
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,420
and it won't stop unless my life does.

434
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,220
I'm exhausted with this world.

435
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,880
What can I do? I wanna help.

436
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,850
I think it's pretty obvious.

437
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,850
There's really only one thing you can do

438
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,540
for a brother in a fishbowl.

439
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,510
What is it?

440
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,830
Move him to a goddamn window!

441
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,240
Angela, he's my friend.

442
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,670
Yes.

443
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,050
And he's delicious.

444
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,730
Here.

445
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,900
Eat this.

446
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,600
Open.

447
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,040
It's piping hot, so consume with caution.

448
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,140
Pop's famous raspberry pie. Enjoy.

449
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,130
Yes.

450
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,100
Yes!

451
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,450
Yes, Elliot, I do.

452
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,280
Elliot, I do!

453
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,320
I do!

454
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,750
Those people in there...

455
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,260
I just told them what they wanted to hear.

456
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,860
You're not gonna do it, are you?

457
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,880
Change the world.

458
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,680
Figures. You were only born a month ago.

459
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,960
You're afraid.

460
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,650
Afraid of your monster.

461
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,660
Do you even know what it is?

462
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,110
It doesn't fit.

463
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,380
Why not?

464
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,600
Isn't it obvious?

465
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,670
You're not Elliot.

466
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,380
You're the--

467
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,380
Hello?

468
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,860
Hello?

469
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,210
Am I still alone?

470
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,920
Is this the face of my only friend?

471
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,040
Are you my monster?

472
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,180
I am here. You are alone.

473
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,730
They all left.

474
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,200
They all left.

475
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,350
I'm alone.

476
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,060
I'm alone.

477
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,310
I'm alone.

478
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,440
No, you're not.

479
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,270
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

480
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,260
We're in this to the end.

481
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,720
Maybe you should just walk. Ballet seems out of your skill set.

482
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,090
What? Screw you, young'un!

483
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,310
This bitch can plie with the best of 'em.

484
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,810
You know, when I'm not bangin' on a keyboard,

485
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm schooling classmates with moves like this!

486
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,450
Oh, my God.

487
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,110
Good lookin' out.

488
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,030
I'm sorry he never came.

489
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,040
Let's--let's just go.

490
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,910
I am a menace to society!

491
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,240
What?

492
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,170
- Wait, where are you going? - It's him.

493
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,400
Phone. Now!

494
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,220
Come on.

495
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,510
Why am I still out?

496
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,800
I have to be at work - in four hours!

497
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,190
There's a lot I'm gonna miss about this gig.

498
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,290
What are you gonna do for money now?

499
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,720
Oh, you know. Just be a hottie waitress.

500
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm, uh-- oh, thank you.

501
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,400
Glad you liked it.

502
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,180
Although I am glad I got in one last hurrah

503
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,690
before going all corporate.

504
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,390
You're not worried?

505
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,030
Worried about what?

506
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,140
I don't know.

507
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,170
I always get worried before starting a new job.

508
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,510
No. I am definitely not worried.

509
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,560
Worry's a waste of time.

510
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,260
I mean, shit didn't work out at one job, so I got another.

511
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,790
That's all!

512
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,450
You worry a lot, don't you?

513
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,490
Yeah.

514
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,210
Look in the mirror.

515
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,450
See that badass bitch?

516
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,020
That's the only person you should ever worry about.

517
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,350
Do you know how hard it's been for me to find you?

518
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,160
Come here.

519
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,290
Yo, you need to chill.

520
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,450
Go to hell, asshole!

521
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,250
There she is.

522
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,330
A ray of sunshine in the dark void of my existence.

523
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,670
Oh, poetic.

524
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,420
But not an apology.

525
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,970
I ain't apologizing for shit.

526
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,030
Oh, this is because I dumped your ass.

527
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,330
For real? You're gonna start pissing me off.

528
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,810
Sorry I wanted to spend my life with you.

529
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,270
What a monster I am.

530
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,770
Things are happening, Cisco.

531
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,260
We need to go tomorrow.

532
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,980
It's our only shot.

533
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,520
Then you never had one.

534
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
Look, I'm serious, Darlene.

535
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,200
These guys don't mess around.

536
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,390
Now, whatever it is you think you're doing--

537
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,480
freeing the world, freeing the masses--

538
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,350
the guys I work for,

539
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,970
they ain't motivated by kumbaya shit like that.

540
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,530
All right? Now, I'm warning you...

541
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,930
for the last time.

542
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,080
Oh, come on.

543
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,740
You know how much this means to me.

544
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,340
Please...

545
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,880
Just talk to them.

546
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,810
My aunt Esther cured all her habits with this--

547
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,560
liquid anti-diarrheal for the--well, you know.

548
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,630
Lemon and salt for the electrolytes,

549
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,760
decongestant for the runny nose.

550
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,750
This is the third one.

551
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,490
Seven more, you'll be good as new.

552
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,780
I'm gonna go pull the van around.

553
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,620
Make sure he keeps chugging those.

554
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,760
Thanks.

555
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,160
Cool.

556
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,680
Hello again.

557
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,630
Long time no...

558
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,830
whatever it is we do.

559
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,270
I missed you. Where did you go?

560
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,600
Did you leave, or did I?

561
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,950
Maybe it was both.

562
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,320
Or neither. Doesn't matter.

563
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,560
Did those hopeful moments scare me?

564
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,160
Of course. Daemons, remember?

565
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,030
At some point an "action without user interaction"

566
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,290
will come along and sweep my legs.

567
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,540
This spinning wheel of false highs and true lows will continue.

568
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,440
That much I know.

569
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,980
Daemons-- they don't stop working.

570
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,740
They're always active.

571
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,350
They seduce. They manipulate.

572
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,830
They own us.

573
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,370
And even though you're with me,

574
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,820
even though I created you, it makes no difference.

575
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,960
We all must deal with them alone.

576
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,680
The best we can hope for--

577
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,400
the only silver lining in all of this--

578
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,150
is that when we break through,

579
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,250
we find a few familiar faces

580
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,000
waiting on the other side.
