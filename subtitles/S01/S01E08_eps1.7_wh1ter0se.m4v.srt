You are turning out to
be a grave disappointment.

- Since last month,

352

- Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five...
- Backup facilities,

Yes.

Finally, you have communicated something.

You strayed from the hack
to target Terry Colby.

360
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,963
This opened a vulnerability.

Suspicion.

- That's why you hacked Allsafe.
- To monitor his activities.

364
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:40,842
And that's when we discovered

365
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:44,762
that he turned your infected
server into a honeypot.

The concept of waiting bewilders me.

There are always deadlines.

There are always ticking clocks.

That's why you must manage your time.

- Until 16 seconds ago,

00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,948
you were not aware there was a honeypot.

This does not inspire confidence.

- Wait.
- There's that word again.

We'll take care of it.

You know you could have told
us about the honeypot weeks ago.

You hack people, I hack time.

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,380
So you should know that
when I set a time line,

382
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,182
there's a reason.

383

You have 50 hours and 23 minutes.

At that point, when all parties are ready,

00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,856
we will initiate the hack.

We'll do it.

- Understand something, Mr. Alderson.
